# Can fasting help you lose weight?

Most of us would agree that being healthy is important. We are `inundated` with articles and health magazines  
talking about the latest `fad` diets, or adverts that offer potential miracle cures for obesity, that  
are often too good to be true. One of the latest crazies is fasting, often referred to as intermittent  
fasting.  

But what is it? And how can it help us to lose weight? Fasting refers to a period of `abstinence` from  
consuming food. The idea of intermittent fasting is to reducing calories over a certain number of days  
or hours rather than a `sustained` period. It has been linked to longevity, and generally improve health.  
It also helps those interested in keeping off the weight or dropping a few pounds. There are also different  
ways to fast. For example, in a five-two diet, you eat normally on five days of a week and reduce your  
calorie intake on the other two. Then there is a restricted-hour diet that sees people only eating during  
a limited part of the day. For example, over eight hours. But is it for everyone? Well, before we get  
to that, let's look at some of the possible benefits. A study published on the National Library of Medicine  
website suggests that intermittent fasting may help with the control of the blood sugar, and potentially  
lower the risk of diabetes. However, more research on this is needed.  Other studies have claimed that  
some forms of intermittent fasting may help to prevent some diseases, aid with `metabolism`, slow the aging  
process, support brain function and help to shed weight. And what about the downsides? Well, this diet  
is not for everyone. Fasting may not suit those who are under weight or with a long-term medical condition.  
Fasting may cause some people to experience symptoms, such as headaches, or make them prone to overeating  
after a reduce calorie intake day. As with many diets, it is always wise to speak to your doctor or weight  
loss professional before changing your eating habits.  And at the end of the day, it could just come down  
to what lifestyle choice suits you.
