# 付高价喝一杯 '道德' 咖啡

Do you like to start your day with `a cup of joe`? Well, you wouldn't be alone. Millions of people from  
all over the world brew a cup of coffee first thing in the morning or at any time of the day for that  
matter. Do you make it yourself using instant coffee? Or if you are a coffee `connoisseur`, perhaps you use  
freshly ground beans. Do you take it straight? With `a dash of milk`, or maybe even some `chocolate sprinkles`?  
Or failing all of that, maybe you'd rather pay a `barista` in a cafe to `whip one up` for you. Cafes are  
everywhere these days offering as many varieties of coffee as there are ways to have it served. And this  
leads to a range of prices from cheap grab-and-go coffee to the ultra expensive `artisanal` coffee. However,  
an increasing number of western consumers are happy to pay a little `over the odds` for their cups in order  
to ensure that it comes from an ethically produced and sustainable source.  

At the `attendant`, a cafe in East London, staff attempt to make customers aware of the story of the beans  
that they are drinking and the impact they are having by choosing to drink ethically. For a start, it  
can make coffee farmers up to three and a half times `better off`, according to figures from the UN's World  
Intellectual Property Organization. Ryan de Oliveria, the Attendant's co-founder and chief executive  
says, the extra income allows farmers and their families to have a better quality of life. It also makes  
investing or reinvesting in their business possible. Wipo's figures show smarter processing, branding  
and marketing make a hug difference to the growers and their communities. Technology now means that beans  
can be tracked all the way from the farm to the cup. The research shows that for a pound of beans going  
to the super market, the export price is $1.45, most of this goes to the farmer. The price almost doubles  
when the beans are headed for large western coffee chains. But farmers exporting their beans to artisanal  
cafes make over $5 per pound. That's because the coffee `aficionados` who `frequent` these places are happy  
to pay more. It seems that that's a win-win situation for the farmers, cafes and consumers. So much so  
that more established coffee businesses are jumping on the `brand wagon` by buying up artisanal rivals who  
have already embraced this way of doing things. If that's the case, then the future of coffee production  
looks a little fairer for all. And that's something that should get anyone up on `the right side of bed`.
