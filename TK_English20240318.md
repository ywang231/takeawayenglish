# When did we start walking for leisure?  

Going for a walk is a popular pastime among older and younger generations alike because of its well-known  
benefits for our physical and mental health. But you might be surprised to hear that `meandering` pretty  
streets or hiking along mountainous `ridges` has not always been considered leisure activities, according  
to Deniel Gale, a researcher of `pedestrianism`. He says that in Britain, walking for fun wasn't really  
a thing until the 1780s. Before that, it was just something people did out of necessity, and some people  
associated it with criminal activity. For Charles Dickens, the famous English 19th-century author, marching  
through London streets and tramping around the countryside was a big part of the creative process,  
a time to absorb what was going around him. He walked at an impressive pace of 4 miles per hour, according  
to him biography by Peter Ackroyd.  

If the speed working is not your thing, perhaps you can take inspiration from another big-thinking wanderer.  
19 century American writer Henry David took a slower approach, preferring to `saunter` over the hills  
and fields and meander through the woods. He said that he could not preserve his health and spirit unless  
he spent 4 hours a day walking at least. This idea of taking a `stroll` to clear your head has survived  
through the 24 century. How does pedestrian `etiquette` remain the same? A 1780 article for the London  
Magazine advised pedestrians to avoid things such as `loitering` in conversation and obstructing people  
behind you with "sauntering gait". 

Nowadays, we could probably add distracted phone users to that list. In this modern age, when many of us  
are tied to our desks and to our screens, the simple act of stepping out onto the city pavements or  
getting lost  in nature may make all the difference to our wellbeing. Whether you see yourself more as  
a casual stroller or a purposeful strider, why not build a habit out of it.
