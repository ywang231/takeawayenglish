# The price of looking and feeling good

How much do you spend on looking after yourself each month? We all like to look and feel good, so it  
is nice to spend money on ourselves sometimes. You might spend your hard-earned cash on visiting the  
hairdresser, a gym membership or `pampering` yourself with a massage.  When it comes to hair and beauty,  
the average of UK household spends just under 2% of their budget, according to personal financial experts, 
Nimble Fins. That's about 38 pounds a month if you have an annual salary of 30,000 pounds, areas that  
were looked at in their survey included `toiletries`,  cosmetics, and related electrical appliances  
like hairdryers.  

However, it seems that some people spend much more than that.  The Booking app for all things `aesthetic`  
PamperBook, a carried out a survey in 2022 of 900 UK salons and freelancers. The results found that  
female clients who use the app spend on average 1000 pounds per month. The survey showed that the most  
popular treatments were `lashes` and lip fillers, while customers frequently visited hair salons for  
a blow dry. But it is not only women who spend money on beauty. Though men and women visit spas more  
or less equally, according to the International Spa Association or ISPA, men spend more on treatments.  
A national survey in 2019 found that male participants spent more on massages and facials per year than  
women £501 to £445.  Garrett Mersberger, head of the ISPA, said that men are more of aware that it is  
not just a thing I go to to get pampered.  It's an actual lifestyle choice with benefits to my body,  
my wellness. Whether you tend to spend money on these things or not, it can certainly feel good to treat  
yourself every now and then.
