# Should we put roads underground?

Can you imagine living in a city without roads on the surface? We have already put trains underground  
successfully, but the idea of building roads underground is now inspiring urban planers and engineers.  
Bradley Garrett, author of 'Subterranean London', says that there is something magical about things  
happening out of sight, that it gives the illusion of seamlessness.  

So how might underground roads reshape our cities and redefine the daily commute? If you want to  
`revitalize` the city center, you pedestrianize the roads, says Tom Ireland, the director of tunnelling  
at engineering company Aurecon. Moving roads below the surface can free up space for park, pavement  
cafes, and other public `amenities`, improving the urban environment and mental health of the population.  
Not only that, it could reduce traffic congestion above ground and who doesn't want to be freed from  
noise pollution and the sight of gridlocked traffic?  

Underground roads could also make self-driving cars more popular, which are often more energy efficient  
and less `prone to collisions`. This, in a world trying to reduce its fuel consumption, is appealing.  
But if driverless cars end up becoming more attractive than public transport, it could actually make  
traffic worse, because cars take up more space than trains and buses. That's not the only drawback that  
may come with a motorized world beneath our feet. The construction and maintenance of underground  
infrastructure are both hazardous energy intensive processes. On top of that, most people do not like  
the feeling of `confinement` you get when you are traveling through underground tunnels, which may  
affect public perception. Dreams of roadless, car-free cities bring both excitement and `skepticism`.  
We may `fantasies` about cityscape made for pedestrians,  but perhaps getting more people to use  
public transport rather than private vehicles would be more worth our time and resources.
