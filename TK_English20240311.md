# Should you build a capsule wardrobe?

Do you ever struggle with choosing your outfit in the morning? If you have a full wardrobe yet still  
feel you don't have anything to wear, you might want to build yourself a capsule wardrobe. So what is  
this? Put simply, a capsule wardrobe is a small selection of items of clothing that compliment each  
other, and therefore, interchangeable. Key to the capsule wardrobe is solid basics like plain tops,  
and ideally neutral colors, because they make combinations easier.  Think about the versatility of a  
simple pair of `denim` jeans. They can be combined with trainers, T-Shirt for a casual a looks or a  
`blazer` paired with heels, or `loafers`, if you want to look more sophisticated.  

Fashion blogger also talk about timeless classics, picture a luxury black handbag that will suit any  
occasion and won't go out of style. But why might it be beneficial to build a capsule wardrobe? Well,  
by limiting your choices, it can become much easier to choose what to wear, but there is another advantage  
too - it can reduce the amount of fast-fashion. Fast-fashion refers to clothes which are trendy for  
just a short time, so are quickly replaced by newer trends. This results in cheap and poor quality  
clothing which has a huge environmental costs as waste goes to landfill, resulting in an increasing  
pollution. According to UK Cloth Waste Charity Trades, the average `garment` is worn just ten times  
before being disposed of.  

So having a capsule wardrobe with long lasting and high-quality cloth should help reduce this, even  
if it means paying more in the first place. Fashion and lifestyle magazine, Vogue, says that building  
a excellent capsule wardrobe takes time and patience. But you want to reduce waste and have some extra  
time in the morning, it might be time to start building.
