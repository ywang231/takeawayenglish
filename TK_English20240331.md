# What are the benefits of going back to university?

Education is a good opportunity for those of us who strive to better ourselves. But for people in full-time  
employment, getting the balancing act between work and studying can prove a stumbling block. So what are  
benefits of hitting the books once in work? Uni is often considered a logic step for people who wish  
to continue their education after school. While options of Master's degree, PhDs and other post-graduate  
qualifications exist, many student leave after obtaining their Bachelor's and head into the world of work.  

After years of doing the same job, some feel adding skill or knowledge to their locker may open up new  
opportunities or help them to get a promotion.  Studying part-time in the evenings or weekends can be  
a great way to juggle responsibilities. In terms of benefits, learning new techniques you can bring into  
the workplace can make you more of an authority in your area and an go-to person for advice. If the business  
has a skill shortage, you might be able to step up to the plate and fill that gap. In short, studying more  
could make you more promotable down the line and more useful to the business. If you study in a classroom,  
your experience of the workplace could bring a wealth of knowledge to other students and provide real-life  
examples for you to draw on. You might also meet like-minded people who you can add to your professional  
network in the future.  

And while adult-learners have to consider things like children, home lives, and work, many adults and  
part-time courses are more flexible and spread over number of years. Some courses can even be done partly  
or entirely online which means that you can manage your time more easily, studying from home and you don't  
need to factor in travel time. So there are a variety of options for those who wish to return to studying.  
And increasing your skills may open up new careers or opportunities in your professional life.
