# 利用虚拟现实的新健身体验

Going to the gym can be something that many people find a `gruelling` experience. It takes time and  
effort, it often hurts and it can be extremely tedious. Most weight related exercises are a combination  
of `sets and reps`. In order to see any significant change from any one exercise, it would probably  
need to be repeated six to eight times for a minimum of three sets for about three months. Then there  
is `cardio`. For some, there is nothing more boring than endless miles spent running on a `treadmill`.  
But what if there was a way to `alleviate` the boredom of exercise while still getting a good workout?  
Luckily for us, there is virtual reality. In the past, playing a video game was sedentary experience  
says Jo Staufferr of the VR Health Institute, but VR changes all of that. He says that the room scale  
experience engages your body in full. Many VR games are played while standing. In order to play properly,  
the player is forced to move around, swing their arms or using their legs. After an hour of this on a  
regular enough basis, it is not surprising that many people unexpectedly find themselves a little fitter.  

There are already a number of virtual reality games which deliberately or not result in their players  
getting a good sweat on if played for enough time. For example, there is a first-person shooter, which  
forces players to sidestep `duck and dodge` in coming projectiles. That's cardio. Or there is a music  
game, which forces players `shadowbox` in order to hit the notes - that's an upper-body workout. The  
potential for VR to help people get fit has been noticed by one company. They want to take the whole  
experience into the gym. They are making a `bespoke` resistance machine , designed to be used in combination  
with a VR  headset. Players challenge a virtual opponent in a series of games which results in a 30-minute  
full body workout.  

However, the cost of the equipment is expensive and there are safety concerns to be worked out, says  
J P Gownder from the consultancy Forrester. So, do not hang up your gym shorts just yet. Although it  
is early days for those of us who struggle to overcome tedium of exercise, a new solution could be coming.  
And a world where a person can exercise and have fun at the same time might be something that many people  
would want. Virtual or not?
