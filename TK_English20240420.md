# The danger of loud noise

Many of us love live music, listening to the singer belting out classics we love to sing along to. But  
while it can be lot of fun nodding our heads to the tunes booming out, it can also harm our hearing.  
Study suggests that one in ten adults have had their hearing damaged by loud noises or music. So Why  
is loud music damaging and what can we do to prevent it from harming our ears. Inside our ears, there  
are lots of tiny hairlike cells located in the `cochlea`. These cells are referred to as our head cells  
because very small bundles of `stereocilia` which look like hairs under microscope sit on top of each  
cell. These groupings of stereocilia can be damaged when exposed to `prolonged` loud noises. Once damaged,  
these cells can't response to sound, and therefore, we are left with `noise-induced` hearing loss, which  
can be permanent. It can also leave us with constant ringing sound in our ears, which is known as `tinnitus`.  

So what sounds are too loud?  Sound is measured in `decibels`. The maximum safe level of sound humans  
are thought to be able to withstand without potential damage is 80 decibels. The bangs or booms of a  
firework display can reach 120 decibels, the `whirring` mechanical sound of a food processor can be around  
85 decibels and live music can be around 110 decibels. If this sound continues for a long period of time,  
it puts our unprotected ears at risk. So what can we do to protect our ears? Firstly, when listening  
to music, especially while using your headphones or earphones, make sure you keep it at a sensible volume.  
Also, do not get too close to speakers that are `blaring` out music. And if you go to live concerts,  
why not take some earbuds with you? Finally, if you get ringing sensation in your ears, it might be wise  
to speak to your doctor as soon as possible. Your hearing is important, but there are some steps you  
can take to be as safe as possible.
