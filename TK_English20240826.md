# The popularity of dips  

Think about the crunch of celery mixed with smooth, creamy tzatziki of the `tang` of a spicy salsa piled  
on top of a crispy corn `tortilla` chip.  Is there anything more satisfying to eat than a dip? Dips have  
become big business. In 2022, ove 263 millions pounds were spent on dips just in the UK. Why is it that
we like them so much? Food writer Ben Paynter cites studies showing that modern restaurants use cooking  
techniques that can lead food seeming dry. But the sauces and dips can replace the lost moisture. Some  
studies have even suggested that liquid nature of dips and sauces brings flavours into contact with more  
of our taste buds, intensifying them. A love for dips could be driven by positive associations. Dips are  
designed to be shared and eaten without cutlery, they can feel more communal and informal. Diners may  
associate them with happy social accasions. British Food Writer Clare Finney, points out that when dips  
first became popular in the UK, people may have related them to popular holiday destinations.  

Communal shared eating may be good for our mental health, but what do dips do to our physical health?  
Dieticians have rised different arguments. One considers that dips encourage people to include more vegetable  
in their diet.  The opposing argument is that dips can be high in saturated fat, calories and salt. Many  
dips have small recommended portion sizes. But that doesn't mean that people follow this guidance. One  
US study found that 48% of those surveyed admitted to finishing an entire container in one sitting. Djin  
Gie Liem, a sensory science professor, points out that people are less likely to become accustomed to the  
taste of healthy fooed if they only eat it covered in sauce. Dips can bring good social times to mind  
and gives us intense flavours. Maybe we just need to pay a little more attention to the suggested portion  
size.
