# Rewilding: letting nature come back to life  

Humankind has developed so much that urban `sprawl` and intensive agriculure now dominate our landscapes.  
Unfortunately, with that, comes the threat of climate change and a loss of biodiversity. What if we could  
return these landscapes to places that `teem` with wildlife, with ecosystem thriving as they did centuries  
ago? Since the 1980s, the concept of rewilding has increased in popularity. But what exactly is it? And  
what are the keys to its success? But simply, rewilding is a technique that returns lanscapes to a wilder,  
more natural state.  It often involves reintroducing plants and animals that used to live there but now  
don't. Not profit organization Rewilding Europe says, rewilding is about letting nature take care of itself  
enabling natural processes to shape land and sea, repair damaged ecosystems and restore degraded lanscapes.  
So, unlike traditional conservation techniques, the aim is to reduce the need for human intervention  
once the program has been set up. In a 2021 article called Guiding Principles for Rewilding, one suggestion
is to introduce plants, prey animals, fungi first, so when the top predator is introduced, they have  
an appropriate habitat to support them. Other tips are more people focused even through rewilding is  
about reducing human presence in ecosystems. That doesn't mean we should be exclusded from nature. The  
authors encourage compassion and learning from nature rather than dominating it. They also say that to  
avoid fear amongst rural communities that their farmland will be taken away and new predators will endanger  
their livestock, local people should be included so that they have some control ove the process and can  
directly benefit from it. Alex Stevenson owns Jordan's Farm in Essex, England and is rewilding her fields,  
hoping to help the ecosytem thrive.  She says, I am rewilding to look after nature and to give life back  
to the soil, and adds, you have to value nature because nature sustains us, we are part of it.
