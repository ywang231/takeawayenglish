# What happens to beached whales?  

In July 2024, a pod of 77 `pilot whales` washed up on a beach in Orkney, Scotland. It was the largest  
mass `stranding` of whales in Scotland for decades. Scientists do not know exactly why whales beach  
themselves. One theory is that the climate change is driving whales' food closer to the shoreline where  
they then get stuck as the tide goes out. If a singe animal is found, it is usually because it is sick  
or has been injured. In the Orkney stranding, twelve of the whales were still alive when they became  
beached. When this happened, marine organizations assess whether a whale can be safely refloated. Professionals  
and memebers of the community often come together, cover the animal in wet sheets and pour the buckets  
of water over it though not the `blowhole` until the animal drifts back out to the ocean. Though it is  
not always a happy ending， for those that do not survive， a `post-mortem` examination is ofthen carried  
out.  

Dr Browlow of the Scotish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, told the BBC that these can reveil a lot about  
the whole's life and the reasons why it was beached. In 2024, a very rare species of whale turned up on  
a beach of Newsland, a spade-toothed whale. While this is sad， the `carcass` was `dissected` in order  
to help researchers acquire new information about the species. From a scientific and conservation point  
of view, this is huge, Gade Davies, a department of conservation official, said. Some beached whales who  
do not survive have their skeletons send to museums while many others are returned to the water. This  
ensures the marine environment benifits because whale carcasses give off many nutrients.  When they fall  
and die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, they form this little nutrient-rich islands that can support  
a huge diversity of life, says Dr Browlow. The more research can be done, the better. Now, we can only  
do what we can to keep our oceans clean and safe.
