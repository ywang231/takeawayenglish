# Are we born to love learning?

Are you the kind of person who hated school? Or are you more like Michael Nicholson who can't stop learning  
He currently has 30 degrees including 22 masters and a doctorate! If you also passionate about studying,  
you might be a `philomath` - a person who loves to learn and study. The word comes from Greek with Phil  
meaning a lover of and math meaning learning. Humans are all philomath to an extent, our brains is hardwired  
to be curious. We want to learn and understand, partly to make sense of the world, but also because of  
something called `neoteny`. This is a term that refers to the juvenile characteristics of some animals  
including humans being retained into adulthood. One of these traits is `neuroplasticity` which helps our  
brain stay flexible. This gives us the ability to learn throughout our lives. Many creatures which genetically  
close to us like primates can't do this and only learn during their adolescence. But for every person  
who loves learning, there are plenty who can't stand it.  

Lots of people remember their school days as being boring or even pointless. Why is this? Educational  
`anthropologists` have suggested if a concept or idea is too complex or `dull`, it becomes hard to link  
old and new idea together. If that's the case, we lose motivation and absorb less information. This negative  
experience of education at school may lead to people avoiding learning opportunity in later life. So  
don't let a bad educational experience prevent you learning something new as an adult. Evolution has  
made us lifelong learners, so take advantage of your biology and discover your inner philomath. Who  
knows what you could achieve?
