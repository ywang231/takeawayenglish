# How to cope with homesickness?

Starting a new job in a new city, winning a place at a `prestigious` university abroad or being able  
to travel for an extended period, all fantastic opportunities, but they can leave us feeling sad and  
alone. What is homesickness? and What can we do about it? Homesickness is mentioned in Home's Odyssey  
-it's nothing new. Common symptoms include sadness, anxious and `irritability`.  It also can trigger  
self-protection responses causing people to withdraw from activities and become `apathetic` and unmotivated.  

Homesick can affect anyone, but there are some factors that can make people more resilient when faced  
by it. Clinical psychologist Christopher Thurber and HealthCare professional Edward Walton tell us that  
the positive previous experiences of being away from home and optimistic outlook, and a settled home  
background can help people deal better with the condition. Homesick can also be less severe when someone  
feels in control of their situation rather than feeling that they've been forced to move. Regardless  
of these factors, homesick does affect most people who move away from home. Psychologist Nilufar Ahmed  
recommends that people acknowledge homesickness, accept that it will happen and work through their  
feeling. Connections are important. Ahmed suggests people seek to fully involve themselves in their new  
surroundings, to focus on the positives of their new environment, get to know new people, and keep  
themselves active. She also suggests maintaining context with home through video chat or other means  
and also to have reminders of home such as familiar food.  

However, other psychologists like Thurber and Walton, remind us that it's important that those connections  
to home do not prevent people taking up new opportunities. Some forms of homesickness is almost inevitable  
when we move to a new place. Understanding that this is the case and taking small steps to lessen the  
impact can help us take the most of new opportunities.
