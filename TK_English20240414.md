# Can chocolate ever be healthy?

When you think of food that are good for you, chocolate may not be high up on your list. But there has  
been a lot of research into dark chocolate which shows it does in fact have health benefits. Chocolate  
is made by roasting cacao seeds which come from the cacao tree. After being processed into cocoa solids,  
cocoa butter, and combined with sugar, sometimes, dairy, chocolate is the results. To know how dark the  
chocolate is and to determine the potential health benefits, we need to look at the level of cocoa solids  
it contains. If dark chocolate has a high cocoa content labelled as percentage, it may be dense in minerals  
such `magnesium` and iron.  According to a 2011 study comparing cacao seeds to super fruits such as `cranberries`  
and `pomegranates`, dark chocolate may have high levels of antioxidants. Other research includes a 2018  
study which found that dark chocolate could significantly reduce inflammation in people with type-2 diabetes.  
But companies trying to market dart chocolate as a healthy snack may still have a difficult time, the  
higher the cocoa content, the more bitter the taste. Plus, commercial dark chocolate tends to be high  
in calories, `saturated` fat and can contain significant amount of sugar.  On top of that, during the  
actual manufacturing process of cleaning, `fermenting`, and roasting the cacao beans, the natural benefits  
may be lost.  All in all, it seems that consuming a moderated amount of dark chocolate can't do you harm,  
just look for a high cocoa solid percentage!
