# 爱吃甜食给健康带来的隐患

Sweet or savoury? What kind of tastes do you like? If like me, you have a sweet tooth, you probably can't  
resist eating cakes, biscuits and chocolate and will sweeten your tea or coffee with spoon full of sugar,  
delicious. But the taste makes it very easy to ignore the warning that too much of the white stuff is  
bad for our health. Consuming sugar is an addiction, the more we eat, the more we want. Today's precessed  
food like ready meals is `laced` with stuff, many `fizzy` drinks contain 70 spoons of sugar in just one  
can. In the UK, statistics show that sugar consumption is at its highest level in history and the government  
is trying to get the food industry to cut the amount of sugar in popular products like chocolate bars by  
20% by 2020.  

Of course, sugary food tastes nice, it can help lift our mood and the glucose in it can give us an energy  
boost. But there are dangers too, a high sugar diet is linked to obesity, and being overweight can increase  
the risk of getting type-2 diabetes. With these warning signs, I've considered changing my diet by replacing  
sugary snacks with fruits and savoury biscuits. But that's boring, I need my sugar fix. I am not along.  
BBC journalist Radihika Shanghani, has gone one step further. Encouraged by some celebrates and nutritionists  
promoting a zero tolerance approach to sugar, she gave it up altogether, thinking it would make her healthier.  
Initially, she says my first `fortnight` involves mood swings, worse than `puberty`. I have `agonizing`  
headaches and feel permanently hungover. This symptom disappeared, but she still found food shopping hard as  
She was stressing about buying the right things. Here experiment wasn't a success. She eventually sought  
advice from Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population health at Oxford University, who said: "Lots  
of people enjoy sugar and gain pleasure from it, so one has to find a balance between enjoyment and eating  
the right amount". There are health benefits of cutting down sugar such improving dental care and reducing  
white gain. But there is no need to be obsessive about it.  

Eating some sugar as part of a balanced diet is fine, and exercising will help burn it off. So rather than  
dealing with your sugar cravings by cutting it out of your diet altogether, why not working on your willpower  
and learn to say no to a second serving of chocolate `fudge` cheesecakes.
