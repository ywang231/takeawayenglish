# What your scent says about you?  

Have you ever wondered what your unique body odour says about you? Turns out, quit a lot! From your health  
to your genetics, we can learn a lot from taking a `whiff` of  your odour. Your scent is a complex mix  
of information, we humans are pretty good at reading it. So, what secrets are revealed from our scent,  
and why do we mostly choose to ignore them? Researchers believe scent production is mostly determined  
by our genes. In a study published in Chem Senses by Craig Roberts and colleagues, participants had to  
match T-shirts that smelt the same after sniffing them. They matched the T-short of identical twins meaning  
their scent was very similar and those sniffing had quit an accurate sense of smell. Ass , an expert  
in human `olfaction`, says this means we might be able to detect genetic information about other people  
by smelling them, but it is not all about your genes. In another twins' study called "The discrimination  
of human odour by the dog", a dog can distinguish the odour of identical twins living apart. So, your  
environment can change how you smell, but it might take a dog's sensitive nose to detect it. Even your  
health can change how you smell. In a study called "The Scent of Disease", the BO of someone with diabetes  
was associated with rotten apples while those with `scurvy` had sweat described as `putrid`. Odour research  
has also helped train dogs to detect illnesses such as cancer by scent alone. Do humans use any of this  
information? King Louis XIV of France was known to `douse` his palace in `fragrance`, perhaps to mask the stench  
of poor personal hygiene. This trend continues today, many of us cover our natural body odour with sweet or  
floral smelling perfumes, and in the process , we may be losing the opportunities to learn more about  
each other and the world. Maybe it's the time to drop the deodorant and pleasant `aroma` of your favourit  
perfumes and let your natural scent waft around, sending the signals that your dody wants to emit.
