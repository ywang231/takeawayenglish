# 我们离半机械人又近了一步

I am a massive science fiction geek. Ever since I was young, I have been captivated by `tales` of interstellar  
adventure, aliens, robots and cutting-edge technology. I always love the concept of `cyborgs`. That's  
a human-robot hybrid. They are ordinary humans who have been enhanced in some way by technology, more  
intelligence, faster speed, or better resilience to disease and damage. Great ideas, but I never thought  
I'd see them in my lifetime. Well, I stand corrected. Integrated biology and technology is already here.  
And people have wasted no time utilizing it to re-engineer their bodies. Take, for example, Neil Harbisson  
who has an `antenna` protruding from his head that allows him to hear, color, or Moon Ribas who has an  
`implant` that allows her sense `seismic` activity.  

Now neither are abilities that I particularly `covet`, but it's a start. And it doesn't end there. As  
technology increases, so too will our ability to enhance ourselves through it. One of the latest developments  
is the graphene tattoo. Not an actual tattoo at all, but more like a patch. The graphene tattoo could  
revolutionize biomedical monitoring. It looks much like a transparent `plaster` but with a gold colored  
circuit board contained within it. This circuit is the graphene. Graphene is a form of carbon, but it's  
200 times stronger than steel and conducts electricity better than gold which is component typically  
used in electronics. The human body is basically an electrical machine. When in contact with the skin,  
the graphene in the plaster is able to read and conduct electricity allowing it to easily be used as a  
medical monitor for heart rate and pulse among other things. And even more, graphene tattoos can be used  
as bioelectric controllers as demonstrated by one engineer who attach them to his eyelids in order to  
direct which way a drone flew, just by looking with his eyes.  

I know the biotechnology is a long way from allowing humans to be able to be lift the car or run half  
way around the world in a single day like I wanted to be able to do when I was a child. But it's improving  
all the time and once the price of graphene falls, who knows what else to be able to do?  I will see  
you in the future.
