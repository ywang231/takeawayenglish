# Britain's April showers  

"Take your `brolly`, it's chucking it down!" , The UK is famous for its rainy weather and Brits love  
to take complain about it, particularly when the arrival of spring teases us with warmth and light, but  
with them come the "April showers", lovingly shared by Britain, Ireland and some of coastal northern  
Europe. What exactly are they? And why do they insist on coming every year? Meteorologists differentiate  
between rain and showers. The UK's National Weather Service, the Met office says that the rain is `precipitation`  
brought bt a weather front, is usually long lasting and streches over large areas whereas showers fall  
from individual clouds and characterized for intermittent patterns.  

So it can be sunny on minute and next you are getting caught in a large downpour. But then ten miniutes  
later, you can put away your water-proof jacket and get your sunnies out! So what's responsible? Rob  
Tomson, meteorologist at University of Reading says that as the hot air rises, it forms the cumulus clouds  
that produce showers. These are then driven by the jet stream - strong winds that move northwards during  
spring - creating rather unsettled and unpredictable weather. Besides the `drizzle`, we are just as likely  
to experience snow as we are to feel sun as strong as that in late August! With all this in mind, would  
it surprise you to hear that April is actually one of the driest months of the whole year? In 2021, data  
company Statista recorded 137.6 millimeters of rainfall in January compared to just 20.1 millimeters in  
April with similar results for the last four years. That's because while there are lots of rainy days  
in April, the showers are scattered,  and there are not as many of long downpours we see in the Winter  
months. But this is likely to change as the world warms up. Weather that causes flash floods is predicted  
to be four times as frequent in the Britain by 2070s, according to a study by Elizabeth Kendon and colleagues,  
published in Nature Communications. There is a British `proverb` that goes "March winds and April showers  
bring forth May flowers". It's a reminder that, despite our complains, April showers can be a symbol for  
renewal and new beginnings. So Brits, instead of complaining about the drizzly days, why not `romanticise`  
that `pitter-patter` sound that brings us the colorful spring bloom ?
