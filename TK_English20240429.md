# Is `slouching` really that bad for us?

We hear family members and teachers telling us to sit up straight and stand tall. But do they say that  
because an `erect` poster is more aesthetically pleasure or is it a key to a pain-free back? It's commonly  
believed that `slump` sitting and `slouch` standing damages our spines. But is slouching really that bad?  
Maghan Markowski, physiotherapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital says that a poor  
poster can lead to neck pain and back problems. She also links it to other problems like poor balance,  
headaches and breathing difficulties. Maghan says that we should aim for an upright spine position and  
to avoid `flexing` and `arching` our backs.  

But if you are a sloucher, then maybe some good news coming from the last two decades of a research.  
In an article called "Sit up straight, time to re-evaluate". Physiotherapist Diane Slater and colleagues  
review the current research and conclude there is no strong evidence that slouching `aggravate` back  
pain and even that a perfect poster exists. Instead,  they argue that differences in our spinal curvatures
are a fact of life and that our backs are stronger than we think. So we are not sure that slouching causes  
back pain, but have you felt like slouching puts you in a worse mood? A 2014 by ss and colleagues found  
that depressed participants in a slumped seated position remembered more negative words than positive. But  
this improved once they sat `upright`. That means that the way we sit might make us feel more negative.  
Should we sit up straight and stand tall then? Something both sides seem to agree on, is that we should  
avoid staying in one static posture throughout the day, we should change positions and stretch. The Human  
spine is designed to be on the move, and the sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of back pain. If  
you are unable to do this, slouching in front of your computer all day may cause you discomfort. But the  
evidence tells us it's not actually damaging your spine.
