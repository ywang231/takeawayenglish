# The benefits of boxing

Boxing has been practiced for centuries. It was even one of sports in the original Olympic Games in  
ancient Greece. More recently, boxing has become mainstream in the UK with hundreds and thousands of  
from `all walks of` life participating in the sport every week. But why? The answer lies in the physical,  
mental and even social benefits boxing can bring. Its physical benefits are clear. Whether it's practicing  
with punching bag, `sparring` with a partner or facing an opponent in a [`ring`](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ring1_1?q=ring), boxing can be an intense  
form exercise and give a full body workout. It can improve muscular strength and it can also increase  
`anaerobic` fitness, allowing someone to work out harder for longer.  

This can, in turn, have a positive impact on other aspects of physical wellbeing, like heart health and  
weight management. But the high physical demand of the sport aren't just good for the body, boxing can  
also have a positive impact on someone's mental wellbeing. Dr Jessica Pinchbeck, Senior lecturer in  
sport and fitness at the Open University says that boxing can `alleviate` some of the symptoms of anxiety  
and depression. Exercising regularly is already widely known to be good for mental health. But boxing  
can also bring a sense of discipline and focus.  

And there is a third benefit to putting on the boxing gloves. Practising punches can be done alone, of  
course, but boxing is not just an individual activity, it also involves working with others, to train  
and stay safe. Dr Gavin Williams, Senior lecturer in Education at the Open University says that the  
cooperation and teamwork can create a sense of identity and belonging. So no matter what the reason  
that attracts someone to boxing, the interactive elements of the sport means it can also have profound  
social benefits. Good for body, mind and social interactions? It's not surprising that more and more  
people are stepping into the ring.
