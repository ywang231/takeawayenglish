# Algorithms and online shopping  

For many of us, online shopping has made the process of purchasing goods a far simpler and more fluid  
process. No longer do we have to head to the shops to browse and `peruse` various objects wandering around  
endless aisles before finally settling for the first thing we saw. These days we find items we want or  
need online, click on it and check out its description and user reviews. If it fits the bill, we send  
it to our bastket and pay.  

There seems to be a wealth of options at our fingertips. But how do we know the options that pop up in  
front of use really are the best deals. And how might algorithms help or hinder us? Algorithms, simply  
put, are mathematical instructions which tell the computer how to solve problems. When shopping is involved,  
what is the problem they solve. Well, the algorithm instruct the computer which adverts to show and which  
products a user is most likely to `splash the cash on`. By analyzing things we previous bought or looked  
at, the algorithm can predict what goods we are most likely to be `enticed` by. For some of people, the  
idea of something guessing your preferences could sound a bit intimidating. But first, let's look at the  
positives. Time is an important thing, something we don't want to waste too much of. By telling the computer  
to show the adverts for things we are interested in, it can save us a lot of time, `sifting through` things  
or services that don't match our criteria.  They can also help us find the best deals.  However, there  
are some people who have concerns about the impact of algorithms on our shopping experience. It is possible  
that algorithms may only select options from a limited number of brands or may favour products from certain  
companies. There are also concerns that we aren't always  shown the cheapest or best deal, event through  
that's what we are searching for.  

Finally, some algorithms generate ads which tell you there are only a limited number of items you are  
interested in left. They might just be there to manipulate you. So the takeaway from this is that algorithms  
are here to stay and it is wise to know they exist. Whenever you are shopping, be it online or off, make  
sure to shop around for the best deals. The first thing you see may not always be the best for you.
