# An ageing population

There is one thing for certain, we are all getting older. And while the older amongst us, maybe `no spring  
chickens` any more. Growing old gracefully is no bad thing. And with age, comes wisdom. However, as the  
world population ages, will there be enough people to replace our younger selves?  A situation where there  
are more old people than young certainly has an effect on the world. A report by the Pew Research Center  
says that globally the number of people over 65 years old will triple by 2050, drastically altering some  
countries demographically make-up. This growing and dependent population means there is an increased  
demand for health and social care. Governments will struggle to provide satisfactory pensions which are  
ultimately funded by taxes paid by the world population. 

And long term, a smaller population of economically active people may be a problem for companies trying  
to recruit staff.  Attitudes to an ageing population vary around the world.  The Pew Research Center  
survey found that 87% of Japanese people were most concerned about it while only 26% of people from the  
USA were. Here, immigration is helping to boost the younger workforce. Some countries thought the elderly  
should take care of themselves while others thought it was the responsibility of the family. Many thought  
the government should be responsible. But old the age should not jut be seen negatively. Elderly people  
have knowledge and experience they can pass on. Some have wealth which they can spend helping economy.  
And some help society by doing voluntary or charity work. Of course, solutions are needed to tackle the  
issue and these include increasing the retirement age, encouraging people to save for the future, persuading  
skilled and educated migrants to fill labor shortages or even convincing people to have more children.
