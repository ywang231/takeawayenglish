# Why are cat videos  so popular?

We've all been there. One minute you are searching something serious like recipe for dinner or something  
for work and the next you've been `sucked in` by endless videos of cats doing funny things after seeing  
a catchy title in your suggested video column. They are `compelling`, `engrossing`, and `captivating`. And  
you can end up spending hours watching kittens making funny noises or `mistiming` jumps. But why do these  
videos so often end up going viral? What makes them so `enthralling`? Why are they more popular than  
dog videos?  

First, let's talk about stereotypes. When many of us think about dogs, we imagine them rolling over  
onto their backs, tongue hanging out or making a mess. They seem trusting and innocent, and they do  
silly things. Cats, on the other hand, seem somewhat more refined and independent. There is a reason  
we have an expression "cool cat". In short, cats seem more serious and `savvy`. If we can `get one over on`  
a cat and make them do something like get in a box that slides down a hill, it is `comical`. But with  
a dog, it's not as funny, because they trust you, and it's easier. Tricking a cat duo to their `wiliness`  
has more payoff. The internet is filled with videos of cats make funny faces or reacting strangely.  
But why are they so funny? Simply, it is unexpected. If you saw walking down a street coolly or observing  
and preparing to attack a mouse. It wouldn't be funny. If that cat was walking sideways, wearing silly  
costume, or becoming best friends with mouse, suddenly we might start to laugh. 

Watching a cat that is normally `majestic` walk clunkily or pull a `bizarre` face is hilarious because  
it is not something that we would associate with that animal. It's like watching someone who is normally  
very serious get the `giggles`. In some ways, we are all laughing at their `fall from grace`. So, the  
time you see one of these memes of cats in awkward situations or videos that make you chuckle, try to  
remember why it is so funny. And spare a thought for all those dogs that try to entertain us too.
