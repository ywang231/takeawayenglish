# The grown-ups who play with toys  

We all know children love to play with toys. But as they approach adulthood, they stop being playful  
and concentrate on grown-up things, or so we believe. However, in recent time, at least, adults are revisiting  
their childhood and buying toys for themselves and they've been given the nickname kidults. There are  
many reasons for the rise of kidults, but it is certainly big business. In the USA, for example, the  
Toy Association says that over half of adults bought toys and games for themselves last year. `Nostalgia`  
is part of the reason, people want to relive their childhood and now have the disposable income to do so.  

Puzzles and boardgames are traditional toys that can be enjoyed at any age. But there is more to being  
a big kid than just taking a trip down memory lane. People have more time to let their hair down and  
play. Hobbies such as modeling and construction with plastic bricks can help people develop skills into  
adulthood. And they allow people to switch off and relax. In fact, Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst  
at NPD, told the BBC: "I'd say much of this, is providing an escape from stresses and strains of modern-day  
living, fulfilling our need to find downtime". Some people are even finding comfort and `camaraderie`  
by playing with others. Although competing with other through video gaming might be nothing new, others  
are coming together to build train sets or sophisticated models. In Brighton in the UK, for example,  
Brighton bricks is a club where adults fans of the toy Lego meet up every month to talk, play and swap  
collections.  

But those who think playing with toys is childish and immature should take notes of the research by  
ReneÂ´ Proyer, professor of psychology at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. It suggests  
that adults who demonstrate more playful personality traits are more motivated, creative and spontaneous.  
So it seems life shouldn't be all work and no play and maybe we should take play more seriously.
