# Can we improve our memory?

We've all been there, staring at a pile of books, desperately hoping the what we study will stick in  
our mind. Many of us have probably asked if there is any way we can get better at remembering things.  
So why don't we look at what memory experts say about this? Every student who have made flashcards  
knows that it can be helpful to go back over what they have studied before.  

According to the learning scientists, a group of cognitive scientists, we can learn things better if  
we wait for some time before trying to study them again. They say that trying to retrieve something  
from your memory after you have some time to forget it will make it easier to remember in the future.  
Similarly, David Robson writing for BBC Future highlight studies that show taking some time to just do  
nothing after studying might mean you can remember things better afterwards. We don't know exactly why  
this happens. But it has been suggested that it's to do with the relationship between long term and  
short term memory. Another study tip from the Learning Scientist is to change between different topics  
as you study. They say this can help you build links between different ideas. Now linking ideas and  
relating them to each other or to images are often suggested as ways to memorize something. Former  
world memory champion Jonathan Hancock highlights how picturing pieces of information in different  
physical locations or linking them to memorable images makes them easier to remember.  

Linking new information to things that are easier to remember is a technique that many people use. It  
could be making letter pattern into words called `mnemonics` hook or by sorting things into categories.  
There are also more general things that we can do to improve our memory. Hancock says that being generally  
organized makes things easier for your brain while many other experts also recommend avoiding stress,  
alcohol and smoking and that we should get a lot of rest and exercise. So the good news to take from  
this is that while it may be hard improving our memory is something we can control.
