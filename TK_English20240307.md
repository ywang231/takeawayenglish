# Knowing our limitations

Humans can be poor judges of their own ability. So you might not be as good or as bad as you think  
you are. Psychologists have found the less expertise you have in something, the more likely you are  
to overestimate your competence in it. And in a digital era where self-assured social media influencer  
give you 'life hacks', and face to face conversation is more limited, the psychological phenomenon  
seems important to remember.  

This concept is called the Dunning-Kruger-effect, named after the psychologist David Dunning and  
Justin Kruger. Back in the 90s, they found correlation between a person's lack of skills and ability  
and a lack of awareness of lack of ability. They are ignorant to their own limitations. This plays out  
in various areas of life, such as in medical diagnosis. For example, Dunning told BBC Radio Four that  
one third of the time, doctors disagree with patients who self diagnose using internet sources rather  
than seeing a medical professional. Whether it is judging jokes, logical reasoning or grammar, the  
pattern is the same: the less skilled you are, the more over confident you are. On the flip side is  
intellectual humility. This means having a modest or low view of your importance or abilities. Elizabeth  
J. Krumrei-Mancuso, Professor of Psychology at Pepperdine University, found that a higher willingness  
to acknowledge cognitive limitations, and the ability to embrace diverse perspectives, is connected  
with more accurate perception of intelligence.  

How can we use this knowledge to help us in every day life? Tenelle Porter, a psychologist at Rowan  
University, told BBC that knowing this opens us up to being intellectually humble, to admitting everything  
that we don't yet know. And current study suggests that those with higher intellectual humility are  
more open to negotiating, compromising and exploring information. So embrace the unknown and remember  
there is always more to learn.
