# Are first impression really accurate?

Are you a good judge of character? Can you make an accurate judgement of someone's personality based  
only on your first impression of them?  Ironically, the answer lies as much in them as it does in you.  
One of the first people to try to identify good judge of character was US psychologist Herry F Adams  
in 1927. His research led him to conclude that people fell into two groups, good judges of themselves  
and good judges of others. Adams' research has been widely criticized since then, but he wasn't entirely  
wrong about there being too distinct types. More on that in a moment, but first, we need to define  
what a good judge character is. Is it someone who can read personality or someone who can read emotion?  

Those are two distinct skills. Emotions such as anger,or joy or sadness can generate easily identifiable  
physical signs. Most of us would probably be able to accurately identify these signs even in a stranger.  
As such, most of us are probably good judge of emotion. In order to be a good judge of personality,  
however, they need to be an interaction with the other person, and that person need to be a good target.  
Good targets are people who reveal relevant and useful cues to their personality. So this means that  
the good judge would only manifest when reading good targets. This is according to Rogers and Biesanz  
in their 2019 journal entitled "Reassessing the good judge of personality". We found consistent, clear,  
and strong evidence that a good judge does exist, Rogers and Biesanz concluded.  But the key finding  
is that a good judge does not have magical gift of perception. They are simply able to detect and utilize  
the information provided by the 'Good target'. So are first impressions really accurate?  

Well, if you are good judge talking to a good target, and it seems the answer is yes. And now, we know  
that good judges probably do exist. More research can be done into how they read personality, what kind  
of people they are and whether their skills can be taught.
