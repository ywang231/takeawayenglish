# How the seasons affect your sleep?

After a long winter, the arrival of spring can be a welcome relief. The days go longer, the temperatures  
increase, and the natural world around us comes to life again. But when the seasons change, our sleep  
patterns change with them. New research suggests that humans may need more sleep in the winter than they  
do in the summer. A German study found that participants slept an hour longer in December than in June  
regardless of their exposure to light. Our study shows that even while living in a urban environment with  
just artificial light, humans experience seasonal sleep, says Dieter Kunz, one of the study's lead authors  
and head of the clinic of sleep and chronomedicine at St Hedwig Hospital in Berlin, Germany.  

The study found that the participants experience seasonal variations in their rapid eye movement sleep  
also known as REM sleep, as well as in their `slow wave sleep`, also knows as deep sleep. REM sleep which  
is when we dream and our heart rate increase was 30 minutes longer in the winter than during the summer.  
Slow wave sleep which is when our muscles are repaired, our immune system is strengthened and our memory  
is consolidated was 30 minutes shorter in September than in February. But why do our bodies and brains  
need more rest at certain times of year? The answer could lay in our evolutionary past. That's according  
to Neil Stanley,  who is a sleep expert at Sleep Station and an online provider of cognitive behavioral  
therapy for insomnia. We have evolved to dark-light circles, so when we wake up for a winter's morning  
and it's dark, our brain is going 'I can't do anything there is no point leaping out of bed.'. Particularly  
in summer, temperature also plays a role, our bodies require a skin temperature of between 31-35 degree  
centigrade [Celsius] for a good night's sleep, but this can be harder to control during warmer months.  

Of course, nowadays it is our school and our work times not the sun that determine when we get up in the  
morning. But as autumn approaches, it seems we now have a good excuse for an early night.
