# When exercise stops being good for you

A hundred and fifty minutes of exercise a week: that's how much we should all be doing. Does this mean  
that gyms are the best way to guarantee our health? Maybe, but they are not without their own health  
risks. Recent studies have suggests that some gym-goers hygiene standards leave much to be desired. Bacteria  
that can cause serious illness such as food poising and `pneumonia` was found on the surface of gym  
equipment. Sweat and the increased temperature caused by exercise can help dangerous bacteria grow on  
the skin which can be transferred to our clothing.  

It might not just be the microbes a gym could be toxic.  Toxic gym culture may be leading people to feel  
judged or intimidated. In a 2019 US study, over half those surveyed felt anxious when going to the  
gym. This feeling of being judged and an overly competitive atmosphese could create pressure to over-exercise.  
The Cleveland Clinic distinguishes between `overreaching` and over-training. The first is the result of  
single instance of over-`exertion` which leads to little more than muscle soreness, while the latter  
is more long term and can have more serious consequences. Over-training has been linked to injuries,  
fatigue, reduced appetite and problems with sleep or weight gain. When exercise becomes a `compulsion`,  
it can also be dangerous for our mental health. Writing for CNET, wellness writer Tyler Leamey warns that  
feeling guilt at missed gym sessions or trying to use exercise as a way to control their bodies could  
be signs that exercise dependency is a problem. This can be linked with having a negative body image.  
Of course, we shouldn't forget that exercise can really help our physical and mental health as long as  
we can maintain a healthy relationship with it.
