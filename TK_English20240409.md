# How to create good habits  

Have you ever made a promise to yourself that you didn't keep? Commonly, when the new year ticks over,  
we make resolutions, going to the gym, studying harder, or giving up a bad habit. Sadly, not long after  
we made the promise, we often end up breaking them. But what if you want to create a new good habit?  
Well, it's possible, but willpower might not be the only thing you need. The basic idea of a habit is  
something we do almost unconsciously as if you are on autopilot.

An example of this would be having breakfast or saying please and thank you. Good habits can be part of  
your daily routine. But if we don't have those habits, how can we create them?  According to a study  
published by the European Journey of Social Psychology, it takes an average of 66 days to form a new habit.  
However, relying only on determination may not be the answer. Questioning why you want something to be  
the norm rather than relying on your resolve could be the key. Do you want to lose weight because you  
want to be healthier or feel more attractive? The issue is willpower could be subject to your mood. A  
bad mood might mean you don't want to do something. You should also avoid trying to change too much at  
once. Remember that it is the case of baby steps.  

Giving up all your favorite foods, going to the gym, stopping drinking at the same time will probably  
result in failure rather than sustainable practice. And don't worry about failure, just start again.  
Finally, don't do things outside of your comfort zone. If you hate mushrooms, don't push `persevere` and  
try to add them to your diet, just to be healthier.  Eat something you like! It might not be quick, but  
if your follow these tips, you might be able to change something for better or kick a bad habit.
