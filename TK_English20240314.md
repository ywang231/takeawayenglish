# Controlling the weather

The weather affects all of us. And an unexpected `downpour` or `hot spell` can be annoying,  
but when conditions are more extreme, it can severely impact agriculture, transport infrastructure and  
our homes. It's no surprise that for centuries, scientists have tried to control the weather - but is  
it really possible? Due to climate change, there are more regular occurrences of heat waves which  
cause droughts, and `torrential` rain, which is responsible for flooding. Although humans are the cause  
of much of it, maybe we have a solution too? For example, China, the UAE, and USA are at the forefront  
of research into methods of producing rain in `drought-stricken` areas.  

And some scientists are even thinking about investigating technologies which can cool the entire planet.  
It might sound like science fiction, but weather modification is nothing new. In the 1940s, scientists  
discovered that dropping particles of silver `iodide` into cloud tops made the tiny water droplets  
`condense`  and could stimulate `precipitation`. That's called cloud seeding. This is a technique still  
being tested today with the aim of producing extra rainfall and, therefore, water for drought-affected  
formers. Other ideas for nature at bay including using lasers to generate clouds and for controlling  
thunder storms. One idea involved firing lasers pulses into thunderclouds in an attempt to suck out  
lightning in a controlled manner. This was unsuccessful. New research into solar geo-engineering has  
also begun. This type of climate engineering involve sunlight being reflected back to space to limit  
or reverse human caused climate change.  

Despite all this ongoing research, there is no conclusive evidence that our weather can be controlled.  
Chris Bell, a lecturer in `meteorology` at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Future: "We might one  
day have the technology to the weather, but it will be in thousands, not hundreds of years." So, we  
still rely on our mother nature to control our weather.
