# The hotel of mum and dad  

There is no place like home, this english saying has much truth in it. The best place to be is surrounded  
by treasured possessions and our loved ones and with a roof over our head. And for many adults, it is  
the only affordable place to stay, somewhere where they can receive first class service from mom and  
dad. But this comes at a price! In some countries, it is quit traditional for people in their late  
teens and early 20s to live at home with their parents, but in other places, flying the nest to start  
their own independent life is very desirable. There is no `nagging` and you can come and go as you wish.  

But there is a growing trend in the UK at least, for young people to return home to live or not to  
leave home at all. According to the UK's office for National Statistics, about a quarter of young adults  
aged 20 to 34 live at home and that figure has been growing. A survey by a price comparison website  
found that 18% of adult children in the UK said they were moving back home because of debt, compared  
with 8% last year. More young people had lost their jobs, and others couldn't afford their rent compared  
with the previous year. So it is easy to see why they are increasingly becoming home birds. The BBC's  
Lucy Hooker explains that many returning adult children enjoy home comforts. These include cooked meals,  
a full fridge and cleaning, as well as their bills being covered by what is commonly called the hotel  
of mom and dad. But for the hoteliers, that's mom and dad. The survey found the average cost of them  
got up sharply and they are sacrificing luxuries and holidays to look after their big kids.  Emma Craig  
from Money Supermarkets says they are trying to look after their children more. If your child comes  
home and you see them struggling financially, you feel more awkward asking them for rent or to contribute.

It `tugs` on your `heartstrings` more. With parents `splashing out` around Â£1886 on takeaway food, buying  
new furniture and upgrading their wifi for the benefit of their offspring, it's easy for the returning  
children to put feet up and make themselves at home. That's before they learn a home truth that one  
day it might be their own kids who'll be checking in to the hotel of mom and dad!
