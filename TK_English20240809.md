# Is watching sports good for your wellbeing?  

If you are a sports fan, you may be familar with the emotional `rollercoaster` that comes with sports  
spectatorship. Whether you are part of buzzing crowd in a stadium or just watching at home on TV, it  
is easy to get caught up in the highs and lows when you celebrate or `commiserate` with your favorite  
team or athlete. Those feelings are so strong in fact that a study from Croatia published in PubMed showed  
that the emotional stress during a football match increased the risk of  cardiovascular incident. But  
can watching sports be good for you too?  

The evidence suggests that people who watch live sporting events experience greater wellbeing than those  
who don't. A study published in Frontiers and Publish Health by Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, found  
sports spectators felt less lonely and had higher scores for life satisfaction. Lead anthor ss said in  
a press release, watching live sports of all types provides many opportunities for social interaction  
and this helps to forge group identity and belonging. She says this then reduces loneliness and boosts  
wellbeing. But if for any reason you are not keen on going to live events, don't worry! Watching sports  
on TV or on the internet may also have positive effects, according to a 2021 study by Tsuji and colleagues.  
They found that older adults who watch sports were less likely to have depressive symptoms than those  
who didn't. On top of that, the sports spectators tended to have richer social networks than non-spectators.  

The anthor suggested that the social networks you gain through watching sports may lower the risk of depressive  
symptoms. So, the cheers at a live sports events or even casual chit-chat with friends about your favourite  
team can bring a sense of `camaraderie` and may reduce loneliness and depression. It seems that health  
benefits of sports are not limited to physical activity through participation in them but that we can  
make gain in our general wellbeing through social bonding.
