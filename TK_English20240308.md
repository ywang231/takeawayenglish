# Think positive  

How are you feeling today? If your head is in a spin because you had a bad night's sleep, or you are  
hungover or maybe you've just got too much to do, the chances are you are not in the best of moods.  
If everything seems like an effort and you have negative attitude, the last thing you want to be told  
is to be positive. But having this mindset could have more benefits than you think. Of course, developing  
a positive attitude is easier said than done, it does not come naturally to everyone. When you are feeling  
down in a dumps, it is hard to be optimistic.  

But a study in the US has found that people who are optimists are more likely to live longer than those  
who have a more negative approach to life. It revealed the likelihood of positive people live into the  
age of 85 or more to be higher. So maybe the thought of longer life might encourage you to have a more  
helpful outlook on life. The study concluded that optimists might find it easier to control emotions  
and get less stressed.  And as stress impacts on the immune system, it's possible that optimists cope  
better with infections. Professor Lewina Lee from Boston University of School of Medicine, who worked on  
the study told BBC that our findings speak to the possibility that raising levels of optimism might  
promote longevity and healthy aging. And he advices that `pessimists` could benefits from doing things  
like imagining a future when everything turns out well. But if you are a glass-half-empty type of  
person, could seeing the world through rose tinted glasses work for you? Accepting that we will have  
problems and we are not all the same helps us to get a grip of our emotions. Some people say it's best  
to celebrate the positives and not dwell on the negative parts of our lives.  

People have been giving the BBC their personal advice on keeping a healthy and positive approach to  
life: Vicki Sicka says "Music feeds my soul, a sense of humor keeps things in perspective, and I have  
good friends who love and care for me." And  being grateful for what you have and lots of chocolate  
helps, the saying goes that healthy body leads to healthy mind which is probably why other people have  
recommended doing yoga and meditation as well as  staying fit and healthy to help maintain a positive  
outlook on life.
