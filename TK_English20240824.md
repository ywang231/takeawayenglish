# How we learn accents before we learn words  

No! That's only word we hear in the latest cute baby video to go viral. But it is not the words that  
baby Orla says that made this video so popular. It's the fact that her `babbling` clearly mimics the  
distinctive Scouse accent from Liverpool.  This now famous infant may only have been born in 2022, but  
the different accents of babbling babies have been investigated for many years. A study from 2009 found  
that French babies tend to cry with a rising intonation while German babies' cries often have a falling  
intonation. Other studies have shown American and French babies reflecting syllables from English and  
French respectively and that babies with parents who speak a `tonal` language like mandarin had a greater  
range of tones in their crying.  

So why does this happen? As children develop, they practise making the sounds of the language they hear  
around them. It's natural. They pick up the sounds and rhythms that surround them. In fact, babies start  
to learn language from their mother from three months before birth. However, it's not just the language  
of immediate family and caregivers that has an impact. Professor of developmental Psychology, Caroline  
Floccia, highlights studies suggesting that children are more likely to acquire the accents of their  
environments than that of a parent who has an accent that is foreign to that location. Why is this important  
to know? Well, what it shows us is that the babies are learning language through practice, and that the  
more time that parents spend interacting with their children, the greater the opportunity for this there  
is. Well, babbling babies may not be able to say many words, studies estimate that they can understand  
many times the number of words than those that they can actually say. Given babies exposure to a great  
number of words allows them to better build their vocabulary.
