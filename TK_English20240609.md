# The change of future English  

You are learning English, right? You might think you can work out tha grammar and have built  a vast  
vocabulary, but then you come across an expression like "plos". According to online urban slang dictionaries,  
it means parents are looking over shoulder. Teenagers are to blame.  They have their own code, including  
text speak, when they are on the internet or using their phones. Text speak  has a lot to do with inventing  
cool, new terms and these change quickly. Maybe you should not be surprised if an English friend says  
you sound a bit old-fashioned. The modal verb shall is on the way out, because will sounds more natural  
these days. Bas Aarts, professor of English linguistics at University College London says, if you have  
two words which more or less express the same meaning, one of the two words will get pushed out of the  
language. People have been shying away from being using the modal must, because it sounds `authoritarian`,  
and people are choosing to express obligation in different ways. It sounds nicer to soften obligation by  
saying might. For example, you might like to read this article. Progressive tenses formed from the verb  
"be" and the suffix "ing" are used for ongoing situations, for example, I am writing this article for  
you to read. But its use has been increased rapidly. Bas Aarts says that it might have to do with advertising  
a fast food chain uses the expression "I am loving it" in English speaking countries. But the verb love  
expresses a state of being as opposed to doing and it is usually used in a simple form, for example,  
I love it.  These days, people are using stative verbs in the progressive more and more. Before you `despair`  
and throw you English book into the bin, be assured that some words take a very long time to change.  
According to prefessor Mark Pagal at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like I, you and we evolve  
slowly, 1000 years ago, we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds. Nouns and adjectives, on  
the other hand, get replaced rapidly - and in 500 years or so we will probably be using different words  
to the ones we have now. But let's leave the problem for the future generations.
