# Is there a best time to exercise?

With our already busy lives, finding time to exercise can feel like one more thing on our to-do list  
So maybe it would help if there was a best time to exercise? Could exercising at a certain times helps  
maximize our fitness goals? The answer is yes, but it's easier than you think no matter who you are  
or when you like to work out. There are clear benefits to exercise in the morning. Many of us have more  
free time compared to later in the day, and it may, therefore, be easier for us to stick to a morning  
workout routine.  

A study published in medicine and science in Sports and Exercise found that participants who exercise  
in the morning, increased their physical activity throughout the day, were less distracted by food and  
slept better. Exercising on a empty stomach before breakfast could also burn more fat and increase  
metabolism, which means you are continuing to burn calories throughout the day. So good news for early  
birds, what if you are not morning person. Working out in the afternoon and evening also has benefits,  
just different ones. For example, your body's ability to perform peaks in the afternoon, according to  
a 2010 study by the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports. Also, in the afternoon and  
evening, your reaction time is quickest, and heart rate and blood pressure are lowest, which reduce your  
chance of injury while improving performance.  But does any of this change depending on whether you  
are a man or a woman.  

Our bodies are different after all. So the best time to exercise may be different too. A 2022 study  
from Skidmore College, New York looked at exactly this question, and the results showed that there are  
some differences. Want to reduce your blood pressure and you are a woman? Exercise in the morning.  
Want to improve your heart health and you are a man? Evening is better for you. But, ultimately, the  
study found that there are clear benefits for both sexes to exercising at either time of day. So, what  
time is best?  It seems the answer is whatever time is best for you!
