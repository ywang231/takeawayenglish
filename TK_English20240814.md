# Is it ok to precrastinate?  

You've heard of procrastination - putting off tasks would rather avoid doing until you have to. But what  
about precrastination? The name gives a clue.  Pre means before, so it is the opposite, completing tasks  
before you need to. So why do we precrastinate? And is it a good thing or not?  

Precrastination is closely linked to anxiety and `neuroticism`. People want to finish tasks early, so they  
don't have to worry about it any more. Ed Wasserman, a professor of experimental psychology at university  
of lowa said, precrastination is the `inclination` to complete tasks quickly just for the sake of geting  
things done sooner rather than later. This means you are doing something early at the expense of something  
else. That could be a physical, financial or mental expense. Imagine you submiting an essay a week before  
the deadline. You feel a hug sense of relief that is over, but also can't add the last minute tips your  
teachers give you. If your marks are then lower than they could be, would you feel better in the long run?  
Possibly not, also if tasks are rushed, they are more likely to be less carfully planned, so results could  
be incomplete or inaccurate. But we are living in a fast-paced world, so it is hardly surprising that  
we want to `tick off` tasks as soon as we can. To be deliberate, mindful and to be allowed to slow down.  
If you think you are precrastinator, what can you do to still feel productive? Prioritize and categorise  
tasks. What needs to be done straight away and what can be put off? Recognize that some tasks need breathing  
room, they can even benefit from it.
