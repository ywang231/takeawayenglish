# Forever chemicals  

Almost all of us have them in our body, they accumulate throughout our lives, and they may be causing  
serious health conditions. They've been called 'forever chemicals', but what are they, where do they come  
from and what can we do about them? The forever chemicals take their name from the fact that they contain  
fluorine-carbon bonds, and because they last, if not forever, for a very long time. These chemical bonds  
are incredibly difficult to break down, which means that contaminants from these chemicals build up over  
time in our environment. As well as in our bodies, they have been found in the soil and in drinking water  

While some have now been banned, these chemicals have been used in a wide range of consumer products.  
They have a repellent effect on oil and water and so have been used for stain-proofing furniture and  
carpets. Forever chemicals have been used to make `non-stick` pans and `grease`-proof food packaging.  
You can find them in water-proof clothing and bicycle `lubricants`.  Particular concern has been raised  
about their use in cosmetics and other personal care products. These products are often used near `mucous`  
`membranes`, like those in our eyes and mouths, which could make it easier for chemicals to be absorbed  
into our bodies. The exact level of risky is uncertain. But studies have suggested links between these  
compounds and conditions such as cancer, reproduction problems, developmental problems in children and  
reduced immunity to disease. However, the level of exposure, of which people become at risk is not yet  
clear.  

It might be impossible to completely avoid these chemicals, but people can take steps to reduce their  
exposure. Air and water filters, as well as reducing the amount of dust in our living spaces is one way  
to do this. Another way is to carefully check the ingredients of cosmetics, as well as the materials in  
carpet and furniture before buying them.
