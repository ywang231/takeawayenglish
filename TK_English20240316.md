# Are we born to love learning?

Are you the kind of person who hated school? Or are you more like a Michael Nicholson who can not stop  
learning? He currently has 30 degrees including 22 masters and a doctorate! If you are also passionate  
about studying, you might be a `philomath` - a person who loves to learn and study. The word comes  
from Greek with 'Philo' meaning 'a love of' and math meaning 'learning'. Humans are all philomaths to  
an extent, our brain is hardwired to be curious. We want to learn and understand, partly to make sense  
of the world but also because of something called `neoteny`. This is a term that refers to the `juvenile`  
characteristic of some animals including humans, being retained into adulthood. One of this traits is  
`neuroplasticity`, which helps our brain stay flexible, this gives us the ability to learn throughout  
our lives.  

Many creatures which genetically close to us like primate can not do this and only learn during their  
adolescence.  But for every person who loves learning, there are plenty who can not stand it. Lots of  
people remember their school days as being boring or even pointless. Why is this? Educational `anthropologists`
have suggested that if a concept or idea is too complex or dull, it becomes hard to link old and new  
ideas together.  If that is the case, we lose motivation and absorb less information.  This negative  
experience of education at school might lead to people avoiding learning opportunities in later life.  
So do not let a bad educational experience prevent you learning something new as an adult. Evolution  
has made us lifelong learners, so take advantage of your biology and discover your inner philomath.  
Who knows what you could achieve?
