# How to stop mosquito bite?

Summer is great time of year, but unfortunately, it's not just us humans that enjoy it. Mosquitos seem  
to make the most out of the season by biting us, and as well as being annoying, `mosquito-borne` diseases  
can be dangerous. What can we do to avoid getting bitten? The most obvious answer is to use mosquito  
`repellent`. Professor James Logan from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine explains that  
DEET, the chemical used in many repellents confuses the insect's sense of smell, making it difficult to  
recognize humans. Through be careful, as biologist Roger Eritja points out, any bites of skin that are not  
covered by repellent are still likely to get bitten. Logan also recommends using plug-in `insecticides`  
to kill or `repel` mosquitos in the room. However, it might be best to avoid using electric bug zappers.  
Deniel Markowski, from the American Mosquito Control Association highlights that mosquitos are only  
a small proportion of the number of insects that they kill and that many of the others are beneficial.  

Clothing is another consideration that affects whether mosquito to choose to attack us.  Amy Glover,  
writing in the Huffington Post tell us dark colors attract mosquitos. James Logan adds that loose clothing  
is preferable as it is harder for mosquitos to bite through. They are even able to `penetrate` jeans  
if they are worn tightly. Light, loose clothing also means people sweat less.  A 2019 study shows that  
mosquitos are also able to use sweat to find their victims. This is why home editor Katie Mortram recommends  
taking a shower before bed to avoid getting bitten. Another way to stop the smell of your sweat attracting  
mosquitos is to use `deodorant` to `disguise` the smell of your sweat.  Masie Vllans, a researcher into  
mosquito `ecology`, points out that compound found in deodorants has been shown to stop mosquitos landing  
on the skin. What we eat and drink may also have an impact on how attractive we are to mosquitos. Vllans  
mentions two studies that found that drinking bear and eating bananas can make people more attractive  
to mosquitos. So as well as using repellents and insecticides, thinking about our clothing, reducing  
our sweat and changing what we eat and drink can help reduce the risk of mosquito bites.
