# A new sport for Paris 2024

Have you heard of these dance moves? The lego leg? A clock blender? Helicopter? Don't worry. By the end  
the this summer, you may know all these words. Paris is preparing to host the Olympic and `Paralympic`  
Games, and a new sport will be making its debut. Breaking is also known as breakdancing. The dancing  
sport is characterized by stylized foot work, `acrobatic` movements and freezing where B-boy or B-girl  
stops all movements, often upside down and balancing on one hand. From power moves like `windmills` and  
head spins, breakdancers really push the limits of physicality and creativity. It was in the streets  
of the Bronx, New York in the 1970s that breaking emerged as an revolutionary dancing form, deeply rooted  
in hip-pop culture. Its has come along way from there to the world stage in Paris. Athletes from around  
the world will showcase their skills in one on one battles where each dancer has 60 seconds to impress  
the judges with their `improvisation` and proficiency in 60 criteria: creativity, `versatility`, performance  
skills, personality, techniques and musicality. However, as breaking moves from a lifestyle to a competitive  
sport, some fear it risks losing its `spontaneity` and creativity. Thorsten Sufke, president of the Berlin  
Dance Sport Association emphasizes that the breaking is an expression of the urban culture representing the raw  
energy of the streets, while B-boy Carl Ferdinand Beccard expresses concerns that the Olympic format  
may `suppress` the artistic freedom of breaking reducing it to a checklist of redefined moves. Whichever  
way you look at it, you can expect thrilling dancing performances never before seen at an Olympics  
this summer.
