# Digital memories might not last forever

Having thousands of photos, songs and films available at our fingertips would have seemed amazing just  
a few decades ago, but how long will these files last for and be available for? Could the digitalization  
of culture artifacts now be putting a time limited our our memories?  The materials that phones and computers  
are made of can decay over time impacting the data that they store. Images can still be seen in faded  
photographs. But when digital data degrades, it can quickly make it impossible to even open a file. Also  
as format and device become `obsolete`, it might become impossible to read files from previous decades.  

Storing information in the cloud can also present problems. Large companies can still lose data. In 2019,  
social media (`medium`) platform My Space admitted losing more than 12 years worth of users' music uploads.  
The wide spread use of streaming services for music, TV and film means that people no longer own the content  
they watch and listen to, they just pay for the right to access it. If the streaming companies decide  
to remove content or go out of business, users will lose access. Licensing rather than buying content  
is an example of how our behavior towards digital content has changed. Another example is that we take  
far more pictures than people did in the past. This means that, added to the challenge of keeping our  
data safe, people have to consider what to preserve and what can be discarded.  

So what can we do?  Technology writer Jack Schofield said that data does not really exist unless you  
have at least two copies of it. So it is important that we keep backup copies of what's important to  
us, probably more than one. Academic Paul Royster suggests we should all take time to consider what  
content we personally believe is  worth saving. Perhaps, the answer is just to avoid digital altogether.  
Science and technology writer Chris Baranaiuk, calls for cultural movement towards buying analogue copies  
of cultural content.
