# 地球快要变成塑料星球

Here is a staggering statistic. Scientists have calculated the total amount of plastic ever made -  
8.3 billion tonnes. Look it at another way, that's as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings or one  
billion elephants. And incredibly, almost all of it has been made in the last 65 years. So what's the  
problem? Much plastic is in the form of packaging, which is used just once and then thrown away. According  
to a major new study from the University of California, 9% of this is recycled, 12% is `incinerated`,  
and 79% goes to landfill. Because most plastic doesn't biodegrade. Once it is in the ground, it stays  
there. It's a situation that has led the paper's lead author, ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, to say that  
we are rapidly heading towards planet plastic.  

He believes that there is already enough waste out there to cover the whole of Argentina. The team behind  
this report also estimate that eight million tonnes of plastic are escaping into the sea every year.  
This is generating concern that plastic is entering the food chain through fish and other sea lives which  
`ingest` the smaller fragments. Of course, the reason why there is so much plastic around is that it's  
an amazingly useful material. We can not get enough of it. It's durable and adaptable, and used for  
everything from yoghurt pots to space ships. But it is precisely this quality which makes it a problem.  
The only way to destroy plastic is to heat or burn it - although it has the side effect of harmful emissions.  
So what's the alternative other than using less plastic? Oceanographer Dr Erik van Sebille from Utrecht  
University says we are facing a tsunami of plastic waste, and that the global waste industry needs to  
get its act together.  

Professor Richard Thompson, a marine biologist from Plymouth University, says it's poor design that's  
at fault. He says that if products are currently designed with recycled ability in mind, they could be  
recycled around 20 times over. Dr Geyer agrees: "The holy grail of recycling is to keep material in use  
and in the loop for ever if you can." But it turns out in our study that actually 90% of that material  
that did get recycled which I think we calculated was 600 million tonnes only got recycled once.
