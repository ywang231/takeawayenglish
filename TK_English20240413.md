# Sneakers: Sports shoes to fashion icons

Many of us wear trainers or sneakers as they are called in American English. They might not seem like  
anything special, but these items of footwear have become an obsession to some people. Get ready to meet  
the `sneaker heads`.  From their beginnings as practical footwear for athletes, trainers or sneakers have  
become big business. They are now a massive part of the global fashion industry. And the sneaker market  
could be worth 120 billion dollars by 2026. Trainers started to gain cultural `cachet` in 1970s, due to the  
popularity of basketball and football in US and UK youth culture, says fashion gallery curator Ligaya  
Salazar.  

Celebrity endorsement from the likes of Run DMC and Michael Jordan boosted the market through 1980s and  
1990s. Brendan Dunne, host of a podcast dedicated to sneakers describes how, as they became cooler and  
more expensive, sneakers become `status signifier`. While most trainers are made for the massive market,  
limited edition pairs are made to appeal to those who are looking for something special. Sneakerheads  
are those who collect rare trainers, sometimes paying thousands of dollars for a pair. Dunne compares  
it to art collecting, pointing out that they have been sold by major `auction` houses and are seen by  
some as an investment. Trainers manufacturers have seen this market for rar sneakers as a good business  
opportunity and have teamed up with celebrities to produce limited edition pairs.  

This feeds into the resale market for this footwear. Some sneakerheads spend hours camping outside shops  
to get their hands on the most desirable limited editions which they can then flip for huge profit. So  
an item that started as an everyday functional object for people playing sports, can now also be a high  
fashion item worth thousands of dollars.
