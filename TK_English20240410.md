# Working from bed

Our working lives are becoming more flexible.  The coronavirus pandemic has made us rethink how and where  
we work. For many, working from home has become the new norm with some people find the cosiest place is  
in bed. But is this really the best place for mind and body to carry out your job? A `duvet` day used to  
be an informal way of describing taking a day off sick from work, but with improvement in technology,  
such as a good wifi, you can now do most of work tasks `reclining` in your bed  while still tucked under  
your duvet and maybe `snuggled` up in your pyjamas.  

The benefits are obvious - no travel time to work, no need to get dressed or even get out of bed unless  
you want a cup of tea! The trend seems to be growing. But for some, it is not a matter of choice, it might  
be the only spare space in their home where they can work. According to a BBC online article, this is  
especially true of young workers. In the UK, workers aged 18 to 34 are the least likely to have a proper  
desk and chair and are twice as likely to work from bed than older workers. Online retailers have reported  
a huge increase in people searching for laptop stands and support pillows. Although they might make the  
bed-working regime more comfortable, the reality is your long-term health, particularly your posture  
could suffer. You neck, back, hips and more are all strained while you are on a soft surface that  
encourage you to `slump` or `sprawl`. Working from bed can also affect your mental health. Sophie Bostock,  
founder of Sleep Scientist told the BBC, if you don't have a good day at work, you start to change your  
associations with your bed as being about stress, deadlines and an awkward conversation with your boss.  
Stress, of course, can lead to insomnia and the only cure for that is a long zoom work meeting to help  
you `doze off`.
