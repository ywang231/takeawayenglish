# Is there a friend for life?

Who do you count as your friends? From our BFF to a workmate, it is good to have someone to `chew the  
fat with` or offer comfort and support. But when it comes to friendship, is it more important to have  
quantity or quality? The recent isolation we have endured due to the coronavirus pandemic has made some  
of us question our friendships. We have fallen out of touch with our friends and `acquaintances` and  
it may feel awkward, but do we actually have to `rekindle` every relationship we once had. It might be  
time to `take stock` and think about who you kept in touch with, you missed talking to, and who you didn't  
In short, maybe it's time to reset your list of real mates. There is no obligation to stay friends and  
writing for BBC Work Life, Bryan Lufkin says: "While people have known for years, friendships are unquestioningly  
good for your health, experts say, it's only natural for acquaintances and even friends to fall by the  
`wayside` as time goes on and it is nothing to feel guilty about.  Of course, it can be hard to choose  
who is in your friendship circle ". This is what sss, professor of counselling at Northern Illinois University  
calls our friend scape. She says, in life, as we go through certain stages and ages, our attention shifts,  
and we want to be around people who are like us. So changing friends is normal, but we still need those  
special pals who have known us long term.  These are friendships we invest time in. According to ss, a  
professor of evolutionary psychology at University of Oxford, these are your inner circle of friends,  
your shoulder to cry on, you have to see them at least once a week to keep them in that circle. He adds  
that the friends that do `drift` are mostly friendship of convenience. But the advice for maintaining  
a good friendship is to share how you feel with someone you trust. This can help strengthen your friendship  
as well as give you both a chance to support each other
