# Humor and resilience

Sometimes, life doesn't seem to play fair. It `blindsides` you sides you at the most inopportune moments  
and even if we can learn to `grin and bear` the ups and downs, they can take their toll on our `psyche`.  
So rather than suffer in silence or let these things get you down, maybe there is another way, what if  
humor can help you get through the dark times. According to author and clinician Kristen Lee, laughters  
and tears are both therapeutic, we need both to process such tough time. But how can we find the tough  
things that happen funny?  

Our lives are really serious, often filled with `mundane` and repetitive activities, whether it is `arbitrary`  
bill paying or fighting for a seat on your commute, we need to make time for fun and play, enjoy the  
little things. Why not make funny noises, to remind you to stop you taking thing seriously or learn some  
silly jokes, just to tell when times get hard? They could make you or other people around you laugh.  
When a hurdle pops up in life, it's easy to get `bogged down`. But the way we recount events can impact on  
our resilience. Rather than see the negatives, look for the ironic moments and tell people about them!  
Why not write `parodies` in your spare time about events that take place to help you `compartmentalize`.  

Script what happened as if it was happening to a character rather than yourself. We all know that something  
in life aren't fair. But take those events and send them up a bit in your scripts! Sometimes life needs  
a bit of roasting to get your thought in order and embracing your comedic side seeing life's difficult  
moments as obstacles that can be made fun of rather than overwhelm you, may help you get through them  
more easily. And who knows, you may just discover a talent for writing at the end of it.
