Pumas are large cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into Landon Zoo that  
wild puma had been spotted 45 miles south of London. They were not taken seriously. However, as the  
evidence began to accumulate, experts from the zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions  
given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.  

The hunt for the puma began in a small village when a woman picking blackberries saw a large cat only  
5 yards away from her. It is immediately ran away when she saw it. An expert confirmed that a puma will  
not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often  
observed at one place in the morning and at another place 20 miles away in the evening. Wherever it  
went, it left behind it a trail of dead dear and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in  
a number of places and puma fur was found `clinging` to bushes. Several people `complained of` cat-like  
noises at night, and a business man on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully  
convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing  
from any zoo in the country, this one must be in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed  
to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think  
that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
