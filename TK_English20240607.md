# Why is lab-grown meat expensive?

Imagine a future where we can tuck into meat but no animals has been sacrificed in the process. Sixteen  
percent of UK population enjoy a meat-free diet, according to statistic websit Finder.com. It seems there  
is an appeal in lab-grown meat as an alternative to traditional meat consumption.  

But despite years of anticipation, this futuristc food is still not on our plates. Why?  One of biggest  
reasons is cost. The first ever lab-grown hamburger was unveiled in 2013 by Dutch scientist Mark Post.  
It was created from beef cells and cost more than 300,000 dollars. Lab-grown meat productions stretches  
from thousands to hundreds of thousandsp of US dollars per ounce that is the weight about two chicken  
nuggets. This expense is partly due to the cost of raw materials that feed the cells, a combination of  
sugar, proteins and other nutrients are added to the cells. In 2023, US based company, Upside Food received  
approval from the US Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration to start selling lab-grown  
meats. In order to do this, the company has had to take on significant economic losses so that they can  
price it fairly compared to traditional meat. An investor in Upside Foods, Lisa Feria, told Forbes magazine,  
profitability is very much years off, because the biggest challenge ahead of them is can we make it at  
millions of tons a year and ultimately remotely compete with conventional meat. There are also environmental  
costs. A 2023 study by the University of California found that the process of producing lab-grown meat  
could a four to twenty-five times higher impact on global warming than beef which is generally the highest  
polluting meat. This is mostly because of the emissions needed to creat "feed".  

So it seems unlikely that we will be eating lab-grown meat just yet and we possibly never will.
