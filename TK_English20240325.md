# How does heartbreak affect us?

Heartbreak has inspired hundreds of songs, books and films and however much we try to avoid it, it is  
something we are all likely to experience at some point in our lives. But what exactly is heartbreak,  
and how does it affect us? Heartbreak often occurs after a breakup, `bereavement` or the loss of a family  
member or friend. When this happens, we experience `grief`, which heartbreak is a form of. And it does  
not just have emotional effects, it affects us physically too.  

The word 'heartbreak' comes from the physical response to loss, described on BBC's the Why Factor, as  
feeling like someone is physically squeezing the heart, though our hearts do not experience any real  
damage. Psychologist ss told the BBC, although we tend to feel pain `viscerally`, the pain of heartbreak  
actually comes from the brain, and it is `by-product` of love. The emotional pain may be understandable,  
but why do we experience such physical pain? According to Florence William, author of "Heartbreak, a personal and  
scientific journey", when you connect with someone in an `intimate` level, your body can actually sync  
up. `Cortisol` levels and `respiration` rates can align , and heart beats might regulate during sleep.  
When our partner is no longer there, our body reacts negatively to this change, causing us pain. The  
reason for this is evolutionary, William says.  The nervous system acts as though it is under threat  
because, as social animals, we feel for more comfortable and safe with other than when alone. Therefore,  
the symptom of heartbreak are a perfectly natural response, however hare they may be to cope with.

So if you have a broken heart, what can you do? Healthline suggests you should take time to `grieve/grief`,  
reconnect with yourself and surround yourself with supportive friends.
