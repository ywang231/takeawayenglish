# Do animals make jokes too?

Laughter is a universal language for humans to connect with each other and form social bonds. Even as  
babies, we giggle when our parents pull funny faces and then gradually learn to make others laugh as  
we grow up. But is that a uniquely human experience? Scientists have observed behaviors in animals that  
suggest that your pets might be secret jokesters. Have you even seen dogs let people come close to their  
toy and playfully run away with it? Biologist Charles Darwin saw this as the dog's version of a practical  
joke. Marc Bekoff, biology professor at the University of Colorado also observe dogs playfully [`teasing`](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tease_1?q=tease)  
each other by approaching slowly and then quickly run away. His work concluded that dogs just want to  
have fun and he's also said that animals may [`goof around`](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/goof-around#goofaround2_e) as a way to cope with stress. In a 2024 study,  
Isabelle Laumer and at colleagues watched four ape species interact with each other and observed 18 distinct  
teasing behaviors. They saw young apes sneak up behind adults, `poke` them to surprise them and then  
wait and watch the response, behavior similar to that shown by human children. 

A sense of humor may have appeared early in our evolutionary timeline. What about laughing? While playing,  
dogs sometimes produce `breathy` snort they could sound like laughter. Dolphin let out sounds of joy when  
play-fighting. Rats make a joyful `squeak` similar to giggles when they are tickled, says Jeffrey Burgdorf,  
professor at Northwestern University. But is a rat's giggle really a sign of a sense of humor? Are the  
apes in Laumer's study really joking around or just attention seeking? What would be the evolutionary  
purpose of animals' teasing and pranking? In humans, humor can serve as like a ice breaker, removing social  
barriers and strengthening relationships, says Laumer.  We do not know if it is the same in apes or other  
animals, but possible.
