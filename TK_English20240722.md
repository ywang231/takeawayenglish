# What happens to our brain when we sleep?  

I am `knackered`, have you got any tips for a good night sleep? Not only is sleep a common feature of our  
small talk, we have also spent decades trying to understand and explain it. After all, we spend on average  
26 years of our lives asleep. So what do we know?  

Here are highlights of the last decade of research. One of the most intriguing development is in the study  
of `lucid` dreaming. It seems that it is possible to conmmunicate with people while they are sleeping.  
In a study called Real Time Dialog between experimenters and dreamers during REM sleep, researchers asked  
questions to participants in a lucid dream. The dreamers signal the answers using pre-agreed  eye or facial  
movements. They were accurate suggesting they could access their cognitive functions such as working  
memory while sleeping. This interaction between dream world and reality has brought exitment to the sleep  
science community. Sleep can also help our memory and problem-solving. A 2023 review of research by Denis  
and Cairney noted that brain regions that are used to learn new things are reactivated during sleep.  
That means while we are sleeping, our brains replay our memorys of what happens during the day, which  
is believed to be crucial for memory `retention`. If you've ever felt it's best to sleep on a tricky  
problem and solve it in the morning you might have scientific backing!  A 2019 study by Sanders and his  
colleagues found that people were more to solve a tricky problem the next day if the problem has been  
activated in in their brain during sleep.  

So, if you are stuck, rest up and return to it in the morning. What if you are unlucky enough to suffer  
with sleep deprivation? Unforturnately, you may be at a higher risk of negative moods and worse emotional  
regulation according to a 2021 meta-analysis called The Effective Sleep Deprivation and Restrition on  
Mood, Emotion and Emotion Regulation. The good news is that there are plenty of tips to help you with  
your sleep hygiene. The UK's National Health Service recommends having a set time to to start winding  
down, meditation before bed which they call beditation and avoiding caffeine before bed.
