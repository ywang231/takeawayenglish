# How sponge cities could prevent floods?

Devastating floods are becoming more and more common around the world. The warming climate is leading  
to heavier rainfall, but could the way that cities are growing be making things worse? Could we design  
cities in a different way to reduce the risk of flooding? As cities expand and more and more land is  
`underneath` concrete or paving, less water is absorbed and more needs to be channelled away by storm drains  
or `sewerage` systems. As they become overwhelmed by the volumn of water, the risk of flush flooding  
increases. Could it be that we have been taking the wrong approach? Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjuan
certainly thinks so. In 2013, he proposed a concept "sponge cities" which are designed to `soak up` water,
like a sponge, reducing the risk of sudden floods.  

Natural solutions are encouraged, using riverside parks and ponds to absorb floodwater. Approaches inspired  
by this have been taken in cities across the world. Auckland in Newsland was named the spongiest city in  
one study. It's replaced the concrete `culverts` around the Oakley `creek` stream with green banks and 
connected parks. This has reduced flooding in the nearby residential areas as well as the amount of associated  
`contamination` which used to be washed into the sea. Auckland has taken a natural approach, but a much  
more high tech method can bee seen in Amsterdam.The Dutch city has installed blue-green roofs on a number  
of buildings. These roofs have a layer of plants on the outside and then layers underneath which collect  
and store rain water. This water can be used by people in the build below to water plants or flush toilets.  
Sophisicated software can even tell the roofs to release water ahead of upcoming storms to maximize the  
system's ability to soak up rainwater. It can even identify which areas of the city are at most risk and  
tailor the response accordingly. Yu Kongjian describe the sponge city approach as using Tai Chi with  
nature instead of boxing. Questions have been raised as to whether a natural approach is suffient when  
faced with increased rain fall gloablly. What remains to be seen is whether increased scale and combination  
with moden technology can help natural methods save many more people from flooding.
