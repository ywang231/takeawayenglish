# Music for the masses

Are you one of those people who find the world of Western classical music a bit `snobbish` or inaccessible  
The Proms - or the BBC Promenade Concerts to give the world's largest music festival its full name -  
might help you change your mind.  For eight weeks every summer, the Royal Albert Hall in London opens  
its doors to all-comers and puts on a music show that is varied and wide-ranging.  

Some music lovers wants to get as close as possible to the conductor. They are happy to stand up to listen  
to `orchestras` and `soloists` playing `symphonies`, `overtures` and `concertos` by the world's top composers  
all for Â¢5. The festival has been going since 1895 and has always tried to be informal and relatively  
cheap. The Prommers - the classical music groupies who like to stand - typify this relaxed `ethos`. Before  
performances, they shout out jokes and every time the lid of the piano is lifted they shout "heave" in  
unison. One of the highlights of the Proms is the Last Night, which has a worldwide screening. Popular  
classics are played while the Prommers wave flags and sing along to the catchy tunes. The Last Night  
is so popular with audiences that a ballot has to be held - several months in advance - so that everyone  
who wants a ticket has a chance of getting one. But it has been criticized by some for being too British  
and `jingoistic`.  

In recent years the Proms have grown so that they now include simultaneous screenings in othe British  
cities, lunchtime concerts, talks, children's Proms, film and rock music, musicals, Indian classical  
music and even tunes from the BBC series "Dr Who".  The expanding offer is proving popular with audiences  
old and new. Perhaps classical music isn't quite so `elitist`, after all.
