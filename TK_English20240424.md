# 科学领域缺少女性工作者  

There is an old `riddle` used by psychologists which shows the gender bias people have when it comes  
to the types of jobs men and women do. Let's say if you can do it: A father and a son are in an accident.  
the father dies. The surgeon refuses to operate on the injured boy saying the boy is my son. Can you  
explain? According to research done in 2012 by Mikaela Wapman and Deborah Belle at the University of  
Boston, only 14% of those surveyed were able to imagine that a surgeon is a woman. Stereotypes about  
who should do what type of job are mirrored in the makeup of the workforce. For example, the BBC recently  
reported that only 10% of UK engineers are women. That's the lowest in the Europe where most other countries  
put the figure at round 20%. That's still only a fifth. And it is not just engineering either. In August  
2017, professor Polly Arnold of Edinburgh University, only 10% of the top jobs in Scottish science, technology,  
engineering and mathematics are held by women.  

So why is it that women do not go into scientific jobs? Sophie, a girl from a school in Hertfordshirr,  
England who studied engineering at secondary school says: "It starts at a young age. Girls are put in  
a corner with doll while boys plays with trucks and cars". There is also the lack of female role models.  
I don't think they get as much as visibility as they deserve, says Priyanka Dhopade, one of the Women's  
Engineering Society top 50 under-35 women engineers.  She says that it would make a huge difference for  
young girls to have someone to look up to and say "I want to be like her". Regardless of their lack of  
visibility, a number of pioneering women have paved the way to amazing discoveries. Let's us not forget  
Mary Curie, whose ground breaking work made her the first Nobel Prize winner in two different fields -  
Physics and Chemistry.  There is Rahaa Cherkaoui EI Moursli who overcame any number of cultural `prejudices`  
to play a key role in the discovery of Higgs-Boson particle.  And Soyeon Yi , who became the first South  
Korean astronaut in 2008 and who hopes her success would inspire more women. Quit clearly, women have  
made `momentous` contributions to science, technology and engineering. If these achievements were more  
celebrated, it may encourage girls and yong women to consider science as their future career. And as more  
women start to do these jobs, more people start to recognize that the surgeon in the riddle is a woman.
