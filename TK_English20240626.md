# Is time travel possible?  

If you could time travel, would you visit the past or the future? You could find ancestors, descendents  
or experience life when dinosaurs roamed your back garden. It sounds `otherworldly` but scientists have looked into  
whether time travel is actually possible. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized understanding  
of space, time, mass and gravity. The key element of this theory is that time and space are linked together  
and time doesn't flow at a constant rate meaning it speeds up or slows down depending on where you are.  
For example, when you travel at a high speed, time decreases, which means, according to NASA, astronauts  
in space age more slowly than those on Earth! If you want to travel to the future, you would need to move  
close to the speed of light. Then when centuries pass on Earth, you experience a relatively shorter amount  
of time and could hypothetically return home where it would be the future.  

Travelling backwards in time seems much more difficult. Theoretically one way of going back is via a  
wormhole. That means, if space and time can be folded like paper, we could create a tunnel - a shortcut  
between points in time. The problem is that there is no evidence that wormholes exist. It's been shown  
mathematically that they can exist. But whether they exist physically is something else, says Emma Osborne,  
an astrophysicist at the University of York. Also theories show that wormholes would be so small that  
a person definitely could not fit to through one. And It would have such an intense `gravitational` field  
and it would collapse very quickly. For now,  it seems we will have to `be content with` science fiction  
and use telescopes to look back in time rather than traveling through it.
