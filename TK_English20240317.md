# Rise in short-sightedness in children

How is your eye-sight? For the moment we are born, our eyes grow, our vision becomes clearer and some  
of us will have normal or even 20:20 vision. However, others will become shortsighted, and end up wearing  
glasses or contact-lenses to help them see everything clearly. And some experts claim that more of us  
will be wearing them in the future because of our lifestyle when we were younger. Even today, optometrists  
are reporting a rise in shortsightedness also called myopia in children. The condition can be genetic  
but it is also partly being blamed on a number of modern day factors, particularly children staring at  
phone screens, computers and game consoles for long period of time. It's believed that myopia also makes  
them `susceptible` to secondary eye conditions such as `glaucoma`, retinal detachment  and other visual  
impairments later in life. Of course, children have had increasing screen time due to lock-downs imposed  
during covid-pandemic, it's been the only way to access education and communicate with others.  

But education generally could be blamed for the rise in myopia. Neema Ghorbani-Mojarrad, lecturer at  
the University of Bradford told BBC Future website, we suspect it is reading and spending more time  
indoors. Every year of eduction complected increases the expected amount of shortsightedness the problem  
appears to be more severe in some Asian countries. Some experts says that in these places with huge education  
success, children spend more time indoors studying. Therefore, it seems spending more time outdoors  
could be good for children's eye health.  The UK's College Optometrists is suggesting parents should  
get their kids playing outside for two hours a day. Several scientific studies show this can prevent  
or stop the development of myopia. There's  been a focus on using technology such as laser surgery for  
fixing myopia, but for children at least, it seems a dose of daylight and a break from the screen might  
be part of the solution. Opticians also recommend kids have regular eye tests to identify any problems  
before they become more severe.
