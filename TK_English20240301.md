# The price of looking and feeling good

How much do you spend on looking after yourself each month? We all like to look and feel good, so it's  
nice to spend money on ourselves sometimes! You might spend your hard-earned or cash on visiting the  
hairdresser, a gym membership or `pampering` yourself with a massage.  

When it comes to hair and beauty, the average UK household spends just under 2% of their budget, according  
to personal finance experts Nimble Fins. That's about 38 pounds a month if you have an annual salary  
of 30,000 pounds, areas that were looked at in our survey included `toiletries`, cosmetics, and related  
electrical appliances like hairdryers. However, it seems that some people spend much more than that.  
The booking app for all things `aesthetic` Pamper book carried out a survey in 2022 of 900 UK `salon`  
and freelancers. The results found that female clients who use the app spend on average, 1000 per month.  
The survey showed that the most popular treatment were `lashes` and lip fillers, while customers frequently  
visited salons for a `blow dry`.  

But it's not only women who spend on beauty, though men and women visit spas more or less equally,  
according to the International Spa Association or ISPA, men spend more on treatments. A national survey  
in 2019 found that male participants spend more on massages and facials per year than women, £501 to  
£445. Gerrett Mersberger, head of the ISPA, said: "men are more aware that it is not just a thing I  
go to get pampered. It's an actual lifestyle choice with benefits to my body, my wellness." Whether  
you tend to spend money on these things or not, it can certainly feel good to treat yourself every now  
and then!
