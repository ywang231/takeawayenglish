# The ugly-cute phenomenon - What is our obsession with ugly pets?  

In a world that favors beauty, from aesthetically pleasin interior design to an attractive physical appearance,  
why are we suddenly `fawning` over goofy-looking pets, particularly dogs with exaggerated features. That's  
been a pet paradigm shift, perfection is out, and `droopy` eyes are in. What's going on? First, we must  
understand our attraction to cuteness. Human babies are pretty helpless, so they have to be an evolutionary  
adaptation to ensure we looked after them. According to Konrad Lorenz's 'Baby schema' thoery, infantile  
features like big eyes, big heads and soft bodies trigger the instinct to protect our offspring. When  
animals have similar traits, we think they are in need of our companionship or care causing the rush of  
warm emotion that is the cuteness response, says Joshua Dale, co-editor of 'The Aesthetics and affects  
of Cuteness'.  

During the Victorian era, dog shows were all the `rage` and with them came selective breeding for cuteness  
rather than health or functionality. This led to a rise in flat-faced breeds with squashed snouts and  
`bulging` eyes like bulldogs and `pugs` - a reminder that beauty is in the eye of the `beholder`. These  
breeds remain very popular today. The French bulldogs became the most popular dog in the US in 2022, according  
to the American `Kennel` Club. Rowna Parker, lecturer at the Royal Veterinary college in the UK believes  
this is partly driven by social media influencers. The ugly cute thing is very fashionable, she says.  
Despite the growing love for these dogs, there are ethical concerns. Many flat-faced breeds suffer from  
breathing difficulties and skin infections. A `testament` to the pet paradigm shift is the World's Ugliest  
Dog Contest, held in California since the 1970s. In a line-up of pooches with lopsided ears, snaggles teeth  
and patchy fur, who will be the loveable underdog that tugs on our heartstrings this year?
