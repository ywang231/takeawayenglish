# Feeding your gut  

Did you know that in your gut, you have a `teeming` colony of microorganisms? You have literally trillions  
of them in your body. They include bacteria, viruses and fungi, and are collectively known as  
your `microbiome`. And while some microorganisms cause diseases, many are crucial to your health, helping  
your immune system, digestion and even your brain function. The more diverse are microbiome, the better  
are our overall health.  

So, how can we imporve our diversity? The single most important dietary factor we found for better gut  
health was the number of different plants we eat weekly, with thrity a weekly being the optimal number,  
says Dr Tim Spector of the British Gut Project. This is because there are different benefical chemicals  
found in different kinds of plants. Thirty plants might sound like a lot, but it turns out that unexpected  
foods, not just your 5-a-day, count as plants too. For example, wholegrains like brown rice, oats, `barley`  
and `quinoa`, and `legumes` - that's food like `lentils`, `chickpeas` and beans as well as nuts and seeds  
Chrisopher Gardner a professor of medicine and author of Stanford Medicine Study of Identical Tweens  
found that a vegan diet can confer additional benefits such as increased gut bacteria and the reduction  
of `telomere` loss which slows ageing in the body.  

But you don't have to become completely plant-based. `Probiotics` help the microbiome too. These are live  
bacteria and yeasts that can be found in yoghurt and fermented food like `sauerkraut`. And food from  
animals can have health benefits. Meat is high in protein and nutrients like `choline` which helps with  
memeory, mood and muscle control. So, for better physical and mental health, grab these plants and strengthen  
your microbiome.
