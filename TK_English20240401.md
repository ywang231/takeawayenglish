# Why it is hard to spot a liar?  

`Squirming` in their seat, glancing around the room and never looking you in the eye. We think we know  
when someone is lying to us, but do we really? A study published in Personality in Social Psychology  
Review, showed that people's ability to tell if someone is lying to them is a little better than 50%.  
Interestingly, other research suggests that we are actually quite good unconsciously spotting liars,  
but our conscious thoughts `overrule` this. `Forensic` Scientist R.Edward Geiselman points out that  
training in recognizing liars does not always help, saying quick inadequate training sessions lead  
people to over analyze, to do worse than if they go with their gut reactions. One reason for this may  
be truth bias. Experts have suggested that we are usually biased to believe that we are telling us the  
truth, at least in most contexts. Another reason that might make us bad at identifying liars is that there  
are a number of myths around body language and lying.  

Many of us believe that liars are unlikely to look us in the eye or will `fidget` in their seat. However,  
this is not necessarily the case. Professor of psychology Kevin Colwell suggests that liars often work  
hard to `disguise` these behaviors. It may be that not looking away or sitting more still than usual,  
are actually `giveaways` that someone is not telling the truth. To see how someone's behavior really  
changes as they lie, many experts recommended observing talking about things known to be true. This  
allows us to establish a baseline of their normal behavior while speaking. Any differences to these baseline  
behavior could show that someone is lying. This is why it's much harder to lie to people who know us  
well. As liars may be working hard to `conceal` their behaviors, some psychologists have suggested increasingly  
effort needed for this by asking them to tell their story backwards. When faced with this increased cognitive  
load, any behavioral tell-tale signs are magnified. It can be hard to spot liars. We are likely to trust  
people and behaviors can be hidden. But if we know someone well, and if someone is working too hard to  
stick to their story, it is possible to see through people who are not telling the truth.
