# Is listening to a book better than reading it?

Picture yourself, sitting at home in a quiet reading `nook`, ignoring the world around you, `engrossed`  
in a `tale`. You read the `blurb`, instantly become `intrigued` , and now you are in the middle of an  
absolute page-turner. But there is a hot debate, physical books versus ebooks versus audio books. Does  
the device you are using to read affect your reaction to the book? Generally, reading uses several areas  
of the brain. There is attention span, reasoning, read fluency, memory and language comprehension. Reading  
is known to strengthen communicative ability, vocabulary and increase emotional intelligence and social  
perception. So whichever way you are reading, there are definitely benefits.

But let's look at the pros to reading with your eyes that's physical books and e-books. They can help to  
retain information better. This is because when you can actually see the words, your attention is held  
more closely. Add to this the fact that with physical books is you can go back and find any part you  
missed, especially if you mind wanders, which it likely will at some point or other. On the other hand,  
there is the audio book. Headphones in, you are switched off from life and story really comes alive,  
almost like watching a film in your head. From a scientific perspective, listening to an audio book is  
likely to help you develop a greater sense of empathy as you hear the emotion of the narrator. We can  
more easily understand `inflection` and `intonation`. Hearing the story engages different parts of  
the brain, heightening the intensity and imagery, making you enjoy it more. Yet, going back to attention  
span, with an audio book, it's true that is much harder to go back and listen again.  

All in all, it seems that there are advantages to both physical books and audio books. Perhaps, next  
time you find yourself browsing book shop shelves, also consider the format. It may just change your  
whole `literary` experience.
