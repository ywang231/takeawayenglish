# Which foods will survive 2,000 years from now?

Imagine for a moment you have travelled 2,000 yeas into the future. Which human food do you think would  
`stand the test of time` and would any of it still be edible. To find out, we first need to understand  
what makes food go off. Food preservation's main opponent is `microbial` growth. An expert in food chemistry  
Michael Sulu, says most foods `spoil` for that reason. When things like bacteria, mould and yeast grow on  
your food, it can become `pathogenic` and food causing disease is best avoided! So how can we limit their  
growth? Microbial love oxygen and water, so the key is to starve them of it. We can do this by drying  
salting, chilling or storing the food in airtight containers.  

According to Sulu, drying is the most effective because without water, microbials can't multiply. Freezing  
works in a short term, but explorers who have found ancient frozen animals initally thought the meat looked  
edible, but once defrosted, it immediately became `putrid`, which doesn't sound at all `palatable`! But  
how can make our favorite food longer lasting if we don't want to dry, salt or freeze thme? That's where  
`additives` and `preservatives` come in. These chemicals help to improve the shelf life of our supermarket  
items. But it means the food becomes ultra-processed. High consumption of ultra-processed food is linked  
to problems like depression and obesity, according to a review of research by Pagliai and colleagues  
in the British Journal of Nutrition.  

So What's going to be safe for us to eat in our `hypothetical` time travel scenario? I would start off  
with anything that is vacuum-packed or dried as well, says Sulu. If you can't find any of that, you could  
go to the Gloabal Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway where there are almost one million samples of seeds  
from all over the world. They are in vaults designed to last for ever, buried beneath the Arctic `permafrost`,  
so either eat the seeds, or start repopulating the plant world!
