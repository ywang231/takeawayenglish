# Finding your `doppelganger`  

What is the likelihood of you having someone who looks just like you, would it be a good thing? And if  
you did have one, Would you want to meet them? Consider how often your facial features are used to identify  
you. Your passport, ID card and driving license, all `bare` your face. To enter your workplace, you  
likely need to be recognizable. You may need your face to unlock your smartphone and possibly even need  
it to exclude you from being present at a crime scene.  

The word 'doppelganger' refers to a person who looks the same as you, essentially sharing your features  
 \- those that you thought were unique to you and your identity. Not an identical twin as a doppelganger  
has no relation to you. The idea originated in German `folklore`. Doppelganger was said to be a spirit-  
double that replicated every human and beast on earth.  So, let's get real. What are the chances of you  
having one in the first place? That's said to be a one in 135 chance of an absolute [`dead ringer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_ringer_(idiom))  
for you existing anywhere in the world, so the chances are pretty low despite folk wisdom promising otherwise.  
And the chances of meeting? The mathematical certainty of finding this particular person is supposedly  
less than one in a trillion! That said these statistics may be a good thing. Historically, having a double  
hasn't always been a positive. Back in 1999, an innocent American man indistinguishable from the criminal  
was sent to prison for robbery where he stayed for 19 years. In the end, it turned out to be a case of  
mistaken identity. In a different case, a woman in New York was accused of trying to poising her doppelganger  
was deadly cheese cake so that she could steal her identity.  

And why are people interested in finding their doppelganger anyway? It may be helpful to look to the  
past when facial `resemblance` indicated `kinship`. Maybe one day you will meet what you look like.  
But we understand that, after this, you possibly don't want to!
